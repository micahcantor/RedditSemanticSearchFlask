Disruption in new car production leads later to less used cars available and higher prices.\n\nAs the new car market normalizes, and I think it will, there's one force in play this article does not mention, which is the option of buying a new car vs. a used car. For a used car to sell at a given price, it has to be sufficiently cheaper than a new car to reflect its condition, age and mileage or a rational buyer (who can) will buy new. This places a cap on used car prices, albeit one that impacts less the older the car we're talking about. Someone who might have bought a 3-year-old car with 40K miles is very likely to look at a new one if the price difference is not sufficient...not so much someone looking for a 10-year-old car with 100k miles or so."

Same for fist Gen Toyota rav 4. 2012 Camrys are awesome. Honda element, Toyota hilux (though they will be expensive in the USA.) Some early Subarus can easily hit 300k-400k miles. Several others. I drive a near 20 year old vehicle right now that\u2019s known for easily going 500k-600k miles on the original engine and transmission. It has just over 100k miles on it now. I work from home so I don\u2019t drive much. I have a friend who buys a new car and a new truck literally every 3-4 years because vehicles that old are \u201cworn out.\u201d He knows absolutely nothing about anything automotive. I\u2019ve tried to tell him but he just refuses to believe a 1997 crv with 200k miles on it for $5000 will outlast his brand new nissan titan that\u2019s more computer than truck and costs $60k. I always look for older vehicles and have always had stuff that lasts forever. I\u2019ve been driving for more than 30 years and have owned six vehicles. That\u2019s it.

Americans do not need $70k+ trucks that are the size of tanks (literally the size of a Sherman tank), when a $30k flatbed Japanese or European truck will do just fine. \n\nThe basic principle is to increase competition. We do have many vehicle manufacturers but they all go for large vehicles or niche markets. The US used to average over 3 million vehicles a year produced and sold. Now it is less than 2.5 million vehicles produced and sold. That might seem bad, and it is for consumers, but manufacturers are seeing record profits. They are selling over MSRP and raising it significantly. The supply chain issues especially forced them all to produce less. When these companies realized how strong demand was, they don\u2019t want to go back to producing more and making less. They all will keep supplies lower.\n\nThe average monthly payment is over $1000. With rising interest rates, companies are making even more with less production. \n\nLet other companies bring in the smaller and cheaper foreign cars and people will buy them out of desire or economic concerns force them to buy the car that costs less. This will coincide with less fuel use and maintenance along with cheaper insurance.\n\nWhen someone in minimum wage can\u2019t even afford a car payment working full time and has no other expenses, why would you think the model is sustainable?"

Cox reports a 20% increase in consumers who leased their vehicles buying them out instead of trading them in from 2019 to 2022. The increase occurred as residual values of the vehicles in some cases were far above expectations, making it significantly cheaper to buy the vehicle than lease another amid inflated prices and rising interest rates.\n\nWhat a dumb editorialization. This has zero effect at increasing used car prices.\n\nEdit in reply to ,/u/Hectate due to mods locking for some reason:\n\n>I think the concept is that fewer leased cars entering the used car market (as leases are converted to sales instead of returned), means fewer used cars available, meaning more competition for those that are available, meaning sellers can demand higher prices.\n\nExcept this ignores that those off-lessors will then immediately reenter the market for new vehicles, which itself is in short supply, so the net effect is adding a used vehicle from inventory and subtracting a new vehicle from inventory. Since new and used vehicles are nearly perfect substitutes and new vehicles are higher quality than used vehicles, the net effect is that the quantity if car inventory is unchanged but the  *quality* of the car stock has fallen. This reduces affordability.\n\n/u/Roast_Master-General \n\n>Disagree. The crunch on the supply of lease turn-ins absolutely and unequivocally raised the prices of used vehicles. Many bought out their leases and immediately traded them in for more than the residual, but many also kept them knowing they couldn't buy a similar car for even close to the buyout price.\n\n>Leasing has pretty much died over the last few years due to market conditions and banks being conservative on rates and residuals.\n\nThe crunch on supply of *new vehicles* raised the prices of used vehicles. If the off-lessors all released new instead of buying out their lease, then that would make affordability way worse by exacerbating the already ridiculous new vehicle market"

Why 1997 as our being the measuring point of \"normal\"? Were things just at their most normal in the Clinton years? Since this is a pre-9/11 measuring point shouldn't we also add in 9/11 as being a contributor to the 238 number as well as the pandemic?.  If you want to compare pre-pandemic to post pandemic, use a measuring point like 2018.  Why go so far back that multiple world changing events happned.  Why not use 1941?\n\nSo probably the price is up 138% from 1997.  But so is inflation.  Inflation rose 89% since 1997.  So the fact that there was a pandemic.  A chip shortage. And supply issues.  Used cars cost about 50% more than they did when adjusted for inflation.\n\nThat's actually expected and resonable considering all that's going on.  But 50% isn't as clickbaity and alarming as 238% !"

When a landlord captures a house, they force society to either pay him a ransom or produce a second redundant house. Building 2 houses to only use one is usually always the worse choice, it's twice the cost of a single house, so the landlord gets paid the ransom he asks. Extortion obviously increases prices.\n\nThe second reason is that the number of cities doesn't grow as fast as the need for housing. As cities grow bigger, they become increasingly hard to expand. They run into limitations and require expensive adjustments, like elevated highways or underground metros. The solution to these limitations is to build new cities and city centers, but that's the problem, no one does that."

If the Fed Res gives up on inflation, then the Govt won't be able to fund itself at higher rates, and then govt spending drops or crashes.  People think the Fed is going to pivot or rescue the market, and I disagree.  2022 was the year of the stagflation recession.  2023 is the year of the Fed ending hikes but holding rates for the year.  Banks now, are scared to lend.  We now have a recession and a liquidity crisis starting.  If oil drops below $50 a barrel, that cheap energy will ease food prices, goods prices, and put more money in peoples pockets and we get a recovery.  Then the bond market will ease up.  I don't think there's any way of having a soft landing or getting away from the pain.

That\u2019s a two-decade high in the share of taxes the 1% pay.\r  \n\r  \nThat same 1% reported earnings of 22.2% of adjusted gross income (AGI) on their tax returns, which means the share of taxes paid by the top 1% as a group is roughly double their share of income. Whatever else you say about the current tax code, there\u2019s no denying that it is steeply progressive.\r  \n\r  \nThe nearby bar chart is based on a Tax Foundation analysis of the IRS data for 2020. Note that the top 5% of earners reported 38.1% of total AGI but paid 62.7% of all income taxes. The bottom 50% of earners reported 10.2% of AGI but paid 2.3% of all income taxes.\n\nThe aggregate the top 1% in 2020 earned at least about $550,000 and paid an average income-tax rate of 26%. Those making more than $220,000 but less than $550,000 paid an average rate of 17.5%. For those in the next grouping, above about $150,000, it\u2019s 13.1%. Above $85,000, 9.5%. Above $42,000, 6.5%. And the bottom 50% of taxpayers, those below about $42,000, paid an average rate of 3.1%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the way, the trend over the past two decades is that the income tax burden has been shifting even more to the highest earners. The nearby line chart captures the trend. In 2001 the top 1% contributed 33.2% of income-tax revenue, nine points lower than in 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next income group, those between the top 1% and the top 5%, have also been picking up more of the bill, 20.4% in 2020 versus 19% in 2001. Meantime, the share of income taxes paid by lower earners has been going down. The bottom 50% of Americans in 2001 provided 4.9% of the revenue. As of 2020 it was 2.3%. The next income group, those between the top 25% and the bottom 50%, used to contribute 13.5% of the income tax. That has fallen to 9.2%.\n\nHow about people with earnings between the top 10% and 25%? They\u2019ve dropped from 17.9% of the tax to 14.8%. That group in 2020 covered people who had adjusted gross incomes up to about $150,000, so this is a story that includes the middle class.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese figures are for the income tax only, so they don\u2019t include payroll taxes or excise taxes on gasoline and other goods, both of which are less progressive. But income taxes contribute half of all federal revenue (and roughly another third is Social Security and Medicare, which are ostensibly \u201cearned\u201d benefits), so this gives a fair picture of the tax burden. The basic truth is that the rich really do pay their fair share and finance an enormous portion of the government."

I have some more thoughts to add below, to build on his remarks on how government collected less tax revenue when it raised capital gains and other forms of taxes (it is notable that nearly every country around the world over a long period of time has reduced their corporate tax rates and ended up more prosperous anyway). Here's some additional information / recommended reading which he didn't include in his video, but which, once you consider it, makes sense.\nSee (source material provided as link in post below): https://np.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/u6xz0s/taxation_causes_global_poverty_and_china_hasnt/\n\nExpanded text version of the above (quoted from the source):\n\n\"[Taxation causes global poverty](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/pv7m4c/microstrategy_ceo_michael_saylor_on_china_banning/heby08u/?context=3).\"\n\n\"Some have claimed in the past that reductions in global poverty have occurred because of Chinese economic policy.  [Such claims are incorrect and have no basis in fact, as I have explained here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q9pdca/nobody_should_pay_any_tax_to_any_government_on/hh0wf4o/).  That discussion was from 5 months ago, prior to current (unsurprising) revelations of China's support for Russia's and other countries' attempts at takeover of Ukraine.\"\n\n\"Edit:  Even CNN's Beijing news bureau, really a truly pro-communist news source if there was one, now admits that *\"the Chinese government has set a growth target for this year of around 5.5%, the lowest in three decades. But the Covid outbreak, combined with the war in Ukraine \u2014 which has driven up oil and commodity prices \u2014 has already made that appear out of reach for many economists\"* and that *\"China's zero-Covid strategy is still the key risk to its economic outlook. \"In reality, the economy is in distress,\" analysts from Societe Generale said Monday. \"The problem, as we have repeatedly stressed, is the lockdowns \u2014 still in place and still spreading.\"\"* Source: [MSN reprint of CNN business story](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/chinas-q1-gdp-beats-forecasts-but-covid-surge-threatens-outlook/ar-AAWjijB).  (This is of course, a polite reference to China's failing economy as their people are locked indoors, screaming from inside and as entire sectors of the economy are shut down by maniacal CCP agents bent on controlling the Chinese people, [who are now openly protesting against the brutal state](https://archive.ph/Mlr13).  Let us hope that this hastens the fall of the CCP in a manner similar to the fall of the Soviet Union from 1988\u20131991.)\"\n\n(...)\n\nBut, contrary to some of Michael Saylor's assertions, here is something that has created more wealth (for everyone, not just for a few people) in the past decade than \"technologies banned in China\" (or tech banned in the USA for that matter).\n\nWhat is that something? It is improvement of economy and jobs, deregulation, and preservation of corporate law structures that provide for the lowest possible taxation regimes.  [Proof here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/m959ep/people_who_dont_want_to_tax_the_1_but_are_not_in/grmf82o/?context=3).\n\nThrough a non-trivial estimation of all country income distributions, economists Maxim Pinkovsky (MIT) and Xavier Sala-i-Martin (Columbia) calculated the world's income distribution (see source at \\[1\\] below). They found that **in the period 1970-2006 the world's GINI coefficient dropped from 67.6 to 61.2, a non-negligible reduction**.   (The practices of taxation and corporate law during that period generally involved lowering of taxes and less restrictions on corporate formation in the most successful economies, yet the GINI coefficient + overall **global poverty did in fact drop consistently over that time period** \u2014 and global poverty continued to decrease after 2006 as well, with more recent policies causing poverty to trend downward all the way through 2020. [The only industrialized nation in the top 20 for corporate taxation worldwide in 2020 was France (32.02 percent)](https://taxfoundation.org/corporate-tax-rates-around-the-world-2020/), a country that has experienced profound and extensive social, economic, and legal failures (as well as profound levels of protest / unrest), and France then scheduled reductions in its corporate taxation rate in an attempt to return to normalcy.)\n\nSo, **corporate tax rates continuously declined over the last 40 years, but since 1970, global poverty has been consistently declining as well!**  This does not exactly fit with the popular narrative that some people like to trumpet that \"corporations and their tax treatments are causing global poverty,\" because that claim simply isn't true.\n\nIt is notable that inequality in the developed world has been steadily rising throughout this period. Inequality has also been rising in the largest developing countries - China and India. However, this **within-country rise in inequality is completely overwhelmed by the massive growth in China and India, and the more recent growth in Africa**.\n\n\\[1\\] [https://web.archive.org/web/20100124050444/http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/4508](https://web.archive.org/web/20100124050444/http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/4508)\n\nThis is due to the dominance of capitalism as we know it in the world today. (It does not excuse any bad or genocidal practices certain governments tolerate or cause - ***such as the Chinese genocide of the Uyghurs.***)\n\nWhat does this mean, in today's policy terms in the USA anyway?\n\n\\- The several terms adding new taxes in the 3rd \"stimulus\" bill, which already became law, should not have been added at all.\n\n\\- The newer proposals from the Biden administration which added even more taxes, as part of an \"infrastructure bill\" (advertised as a 3.5 trillion dollar bill, but which actually had a minimum cost of over 9 trillion), which unfortunately also mostly became law, were likewise completely unnecessary and will reverse economic progress.\n\n\\- There should in fact be less taxation than we currently have - not more.\n\n\\- The [growing uses of crypto systems being gradually established in outer space](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/paixdr/blockchain_in_space_whats_going_on_4_years_after/) \\- essentially outside jurisdictions of planet Earth - should cause governments of earth to become more competitive, rather than more dinosaur-like as they approach cryptocurrencies.\n\nHistory and numbers don't lie:  **improving economy and jobs, focusing on deregulation, and preservation of corporate law structures that provide for the lowest possible taxation regimes, all help result in reduction of global poverty.**   That's what created more wealth in the past decade, for everyone."

Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their correspondence with GPT capabilities, incorporating both human expertise and classifications from GPT-4. Our findings indicate that approximately 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of GPTs, while around 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted. The influence spans all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure. Notably, the impact is not limited to industries with higher recent productivity growth. We conclude that Generative Pre-trained Transformers exhibit characteristics of general-purpose technologies (GPTs), suggesting that as these models could have notable economic, social, and policy implications.\n\nAccess to the full paper [here.](https://docdro.id/94DqSva)\n\nCommentary and highlights by some of the authors [here](https://twitter.com/ManlikeMishap/status/1637939929291292674) and [here.](https://twitter.com/sj_manning/status/1637888162654453760?cxt=HHwWgICwzeSm-botAAAA)"

They have to figure out how many banks have huge portfolios of 10, 20, 30 year bonds and what the hidden losses are.  Then they have to figure out if they want to back stop it or not.  The FED RES could do some type of cash for bonds swap at face value rather than market value to cover the losses without stimulating the economy.  Based on Powells comments last week, they are not going to shift to broad general QE.  It's not the end of an economic cycle without some banks failing, this is normal.  If the problem is that they could all fail, that's a problem that needs to be dealt with proactively.  Now, I'll ask...  Who else has huge bond portfolios?   Pensions, Insurance companies...  Who has giant balloon based financing that when it comes due, may not be able to afford higher rates?  REITs and large Realestate Hedge Funds and Investors...   Banks are just one player that has to adjust to where the bond market went.  The FED RES only controls short rates to banks, not the bond market.  Raising rates is actually trying to kill inflation so that the long bonds don't rise further, which has a lot of compounding.   I think a lot of folks believe the news when the news said the Fed caused all this when it's really the bond market moving.  Supply chain issues, the Fed Res not tightening early enough, and the fear of higher energy prices from war all caused the inflation."

Comparing current rents with current financing costs is apples to oranges because effectively you need to add the rise in rents/ rise in value due to inflation to your ex ante rental yield. In the (admittedly distant) past it was a common thing that prima facie, rental yields were lower than financing costs because people understood that you finance a real (\"past inflation\") asset with a nominal (\"before inflation\") loan. Yes it might mean that people who don't buy with equity can't buy but again, that is a \"normal era\" thing. You'all are just to used to free money..."

Devastating the economy of the South in the 1860s meant that by the turn of the 20th century, things were only just getting stabilized again. Geographic isolation from WWI propelled the 1920's economic boom while the rest of the world languished in a recession that would eventually pile up into the Great Depression and lead to WWII. \n\nThis whole \"cyclical century\" idea seems to ignore the first 20 years of the 21st century revolving around depleting the US economy in Iraq and Afghanistan, as opposed to isolation. Globalism and offshoring seems to be cooling a touch, but the US manufacturing sector has been a specter of what it once was. For example, the prestige economy relied on relative good pay for jobs where cost of living was low, in industries that fed each other in a somewhat boundless environment. Very few markets for consumer products had been saturated - in fact, creating new products grew at such a pace that we saw exponential growth just as new waves of things to make kept coming and coming. \n\nSure, you have some steps in common, but considering the impact that supply chain slowdowns have had on inflation globally, it's hard to see parallels between the 20th and 21st century without some real effort to shoehorn data on one or the other."

It doesn\u2019t make the case at all that those things don\u2019t measure skills and accomplishment - which is what they exist for. \n\nThen it argues that money and \"brand\" are unreliable proxies or \"prestige\". This doesn't make sense as education and training credentials and experience (resume), which is what most employers go by, aren\u2019t \u201cmoney\u201d. Employers will try to learn what you've previously earned, but usually to see what they'll have to pay you not to understand how capable you are.\n\nIf anything reading between the lines, it feels like to the blogger that maybe these measures are too accurate and they'd like to avoid being as accountable as they make you, and would rather \"opt out\" and be a bartering digital nomad maker.\n\nSure there's the exception of the billionaire worshippers, which goes back to the Robber Barons.  In practice most of the time I don\u2019t think \u201chow much money you have\u201d is currently how anyone primarily measures skill and accomplishment or potential with a specific task or role - that would be extremely unreliable (I need someone to develop a sophisticated Java application - how much money do you have?). It correlates with success but is just one thing that influences perception.\n\n\nAs for the OP question - just not seeing it in the US. \n\nPoverty rates are at historic lows.\n\nMedian incomes are at historic highs even adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe biggest change is that there are a minority of very wealthy people enjoying most of the benefits of technology driven productivity increases in recent decades.

Ive enjoyed reading others opinions here and they are wide ranged, meaning nobody really knows how our future plays out.\n\nMy take.  Our ecomomy is far more financialized today than the 1930s.  People then couldnt buy anything because they had no money.  In our near future people will have plenty of money but still wont be able to buy anything.  The depression was a deflationary deleveraging period whereas today and into the future we will see more periods of inflationary deleveraging. Stagnant to negative growth, rapidly increasing prices, and much higher taxation.  Past excesses must be worked out of the system and this is the only path forward as debt levels are very high.  Government and corporate debt needs to be reduced and inflation is less painful to tptb than default.  Especially for government whose main goal is self preservation.\n\nI dont know what that looks like in the future but its unlikely it leads the US to an agriculture based economy.  I would like to see labor and productivity seen as more useful than capital which is where we are at today.  This has led to misallocation of resources and the creation of what i label as bullshit jobs."

One said that the subsistence era in the USA went to the end of the 1800's, but it seems to me that the subsistence era ended in the mid 1700's with the Industrial Revolution.  Going back to a subsistence economy would probably result in a 90 percent drop in population.  It should also be noted that the Great Depression was in the 1930's, not the 1920's.\n\nI think that the period today can be compared to the period before Teddy Roosevelt, the great trust-buster, through the stock market crash of 1929.  There was a huge wealth gap, with the bulk of the population living in near poverty to support a few super-rich.  Companies made a lot of money though bribery, attempted bribery, and downright fraud.  For example, the railroads attempted to have Congress cancel the need for the repayment of the loans that they had been given to build them in the first place.  \n\nAmerican companies made huge profits from plantations in other countries by having the US military insist on their only have to pay limited amounts for their product.  France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and many others did the same thing.  The only difference now is that countries like India and China are making fortunes for the rich by making sure that their own citizens don't ask for higher wages or higher quality goods.\n\nMuch of the value of stocks today have as much meaning as the price of tulips in the tulip craze or the stocks in the twenties whose purchase was highly leveraged to the point where the slightest instability caused a mighty crash.  Low interest rates reduce incentives to save, lack of saving makes it difficult to have real capital improvements, and lack of improvements means that the companies collapse together with the value of their property.\n\nBuyer beware has been immoral since Biblical times.  Why do you think merchants were prohibited from carrying two sets of weights.  Why do you think we have the FDA and antitrust laws today.  If firms can get away with selling shoddy goods, you end up with a race to  the bottom.\n\nBy the way, the article is an attempt to make money by having people buy his book on the \"secrets\" of success."

We went to a \"desk sharing\" model where you can work at any desk. No assigned desks anymore. File cabinets and such got moved to the corner of the office. 75% of the cubicles were dismantled and hauled off. Now we're negotiating for a 75% reduction in leased space. At one point there was talks of canceling the office lease entirely and moving into a shared office space like regus where we basically rent a meeting room for 4 hours to do our monthly meetings. 100% of our job can be done through teams, outlook, phone calls etc. There is no need for in-person anything anymore.\n\nKeep in mind, this is a government which normally is slow to adjust to anything. I would imagine corporate and private businesses are being more aggressive due to how much you can save.\n\nThe other thing is so many people want fully remote jobs now and I think the managers have noticed that. We can't really compete against private sector in terms of wages....but we can sure as heck offer you fully remote.

Without a commute, employees can save on gas or public transportation costs, and companies can save on office rent and utilities.\n\nIncreased productivity: Studies have shown that employees who work from home are often more productive than those who work in an office.

This can lead to better hiring decisions and a more diverse workforce.\n\nReduced absenteeism: Working from home can reduce absenteeism due to illness or family obligations, since employees can more easily work from home when they need to.\nReduced environmental impact: With fewer people commuting to work, there is a reduced environmental impact from cars, buses, and trains.\n\nNot to mention we can change the zoning to allow the unused offices to be used for housing."

Option B is a spike in unemployment hits a relatively small number of people but hits them very hard. Those are the two options. Most policymakers and the general public tend to chose option B.

The provincial regulators in Canada as well as the CSA merely handle registration and only pursure enforcement actions in the largest of cases. IIROC, however, does perform traditional market surveillance, auditing, and enforcement - although it is also a mostly-toothless entity. Officially, according to the federal government, Crypto is not classified as a traditional asset so there is little by way of legal framework to govern the trading of crypto as an asset class in general. There is a push at all levels to have IIROC surveil the crypto markets, but that effort is largely academic at this point. It sounds like the author is miffed about the current hurdles to becoming a regulated crypto exchange and gaining access to the traditional banking system. This is very tough in Canada, but so is becoming a marketplace for traditional asset trading so I am not sure what the author is even on about."

The best example is the weird shit that happens in Hawaii to get around the Jones Act. Inter-island shipping has to make stops in places like Canada or Mexico to get around limitations. There is no domestic shipping to make up the \"slack\" so adding thousands of miles of travel is still cheaper than using an American flagged ship. When I went on a Hawaiian Cruise we made a stop in Fanning Island (in Kiribati) so the company would comply with the Jones' Act.   \n\n\nI do think there are good strategic reasons to support the U.S. shipping industry, but the Jones' Act doesn't really do that, at all."

Repealing the jones act means that shipbuilders *and* shippers will have to be competitive or die. \n\nCounterpoint: Without the Jones act, the outcome would be worse than it is because there's no way to rewind the clock on the progression in production cost drop from Japan to South Korea to China. There is absolutely 0 way. If the jones act is repealed the only thing it does is essentially sign the death knell for any commercial shipbuilder that's still even left in the U.S. at this point. \n\nFor shipping costs, any small american shipping line is almost immediately put out of business because they can't scale or cut their per TEU rates. \n\nSecond point: Jones act increases truck traffic and causes congestion and environmental issues and we should be shipping things via ship instead of trucks\n\nCounterpoint: Ships are good ways to ship bulk/commodity goods in large quantities, super long distances across water but still rely on trucks to do the actual deliveries, so it doesn't nothing to mitigate the truck traffic generated from port sources as they spread out away from the port. \n\nPorts need to be large to be efficient and justify the capital expenditure, which means that you're not going to have a bunch of small cargo terminals dotted everywhere for whatever small efficient vessel this author dreamed up. \n\nContainer ships are also bad ways to ship things across the continental U.S. when railways are available, and the market already prices that in. \n\nThe only thing that might be the case is river based shipping but it has its own issues, largely with scale, but the Jones act doesn't really interfere with it, and there's investment in shipping terminals for container traffic on the mississippi and new X-bow type COV service from APH to service that \"new\" area.\n\nThird point: Emergency shipping to non-conus areas like Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, or Guam is hampered by the jones act\n\nCounterpoint: U.S. utilizes the navy to do the bulk of emergency shipping using its rather large cargo delivery capability via sea, jones act waivers also exist and are frequently granted in emergency situations when warranted, and not banked on \"public outcry\" to grant them."

But regulators spending time debating whether FDIC protection and contagion is a waste of time.\n\nBecause the next big wave of depositor redemptions is upon us. And depositors are leaving not because of fear. They're leaving because of DISINTERMEDIATION. Money market mutual funds yield 200-300 bps more than bank demand deposits. Savers are slowly awakening from their slumber and realizing that 0% is not an automatic interest rate on savings. You can not save banks with incompetent asset liability management with higher FDIC limits, not in the long run. And with disintermediation , not in the medium run either."

An increasingly high proportion of these workers in the United States were born abroad and permitted to work on skilled worker visas. How do multinational firms respond when artificial constraints, namely, policies restricting skilled immigration, are placed on their ability to hire scarce human capital? This paper combines visa microdata and comprehensive data on U.S. multinational firm activity to demonstrate that firms respond to restrictions on H-1B immigration by increasing foreign affiliate employment at the intensive and extensive margins, particularly in China, India, and Canada. The most impacted jobs were R&D-intensive ones, but there is some evidence that non-R&D employment was also affected. The paper highlights a means by which firms can circumvent constraining policies and mitigate country-level risk, and it also suggests that, for the average multinational company (MNC), this means is imperfect; for every visa rejection, they hire 0.4 employees abroad. The most globalized MNCs are the most likely to respond to these restrictions by offshoring, highlighting that firm capabilities\u2014in the form of prior internationalization\u2014shape the decision and ability to offshore in response to skilled immigration restrictions; indeed, these firms hire 0.9 employees abroad for every visa rejection. More broadly, the paper provides evidence of a push factor for internationalizing knowledge activity: artificial constraints on resources result in firms circumventing restrictive policies in ways that may not be anticipated by policy makers."

Economics Department Working Paper Series. 343. Retrieved from https://scholarworks.umass.edu/econ_workingpaper/343\n\nExcerpt from the linked paper:^1\n\n>The dominant view of inflation holds that it is macroeconomic in origin and must always be tackled with macroeconomic tightening. \n\n>In contrast, we argue that the US COVID-19 inflation is predominantly a sellers\u2019 inflation that derives from microeconomic origins, namely the ability of firms with market power to hike prices. Such firms are price makers, but they only engage in price hikes if they expect their competitors to do the same. \n\n>This requires an implicit agreement which can be coordinated by sector-wide cost shocks and supply bottlenecks. \n\n>We review the long-standing literature on price-setting in concentrated markets and survey earnings calls and compile firm-level data to derive a three-stage heuristic of the inflationary process: \n\n>(1) Rising prices in systemically significant upstream sectors due to commodity market dynamics or bottlenecks create windfall profits and provide an impulse for further price hikes. \n\n>(2) To protect profit margins from rising costs, downstream sectors propagate, or in cases of temporary monopolies due to bottlenecks, amplify price pressures. \n\n>(3) Labor responds by trying to fend off real wage declines in the conflict stage. \n\n>We argue that such sellers\u2019 inflation generates a general price rise which may be transitory, but can also lead to self-sustaining inflationary spirals under certain conditions.\n\n>&nbsp;\n\n>The sectors and companies we have discussed for the impulse stage are merely examples, but they illustrate how windfall profits were reaped following specific price hikes. \n\n>Exploding prices became exploding costs for other companies across the economy. Since the economy is a network of input-output relationships, there is no clear beginning or end to price hikes \u2013 e.g. steel matters for oil and oil for steel. \n\n>Nevertheless, some companies matter more for inflation than others, and we grouped them in the impulse stage insofar as they have seen large margin, profit and price increases, and rank highly in terms of the number of forward linkages.\n\n>There are also examples of upstream industries that acquired systemic significance during the period of inflation but displayed more of a propagation rather than an impulse pattern.\n\n>In [the case of CH Robinson and Home Depot] we see large price increases even when demand began falling as the pandemic boom ceased. This is consistent with the principle we laid out above: firms with market power price primarily to protect profits, not to induce demand (with the exception of promotions). \n\n>An even more extreme example of price increases in response to declining demand is Starbucks (Appendix Figure 18).\n\n>&nbsp;\n\n>Some firms have managed to not only protect margins but increase them in varying degrees by raising prices, thus amplifying the overall inflation dynamic. \n\n>Procter and Gamble, for example, a producer of hygiene and health care products that enjoyed strong demand during 2020, managed to increase margins and profit volumes somewhat above the pre-pandemic level and to keep them there due to price increases when volume growth declined (Appendix Figure 17).\n\n>Simply put, selling goods that people depend on gives Procter and Gamble space to raise prices.\n\n>Sellers\u2019 inflation is not possible in a perfectly competitive economy, but in a highly concentrated economy in which large firms are price makers, it is a real possibility \u2013 as we are witnessing again today.\n\n>Large firms also tend to have more financing options beyond bank loans, which can make them generally less dependent on bank rates.\n\n^1 Sellers\u2019 inflation, profits and conflict: Why can large firms hike prices in an emergency?

                    "CommentBody": "So we're looking at a Consumer Price Index (CPI) of six percent with Federal Reserve rate of five percent? What's the disincentive to continue maximizing debt? \n\nAfter all, that's the issue that we're experiencing: over leverage. The entire U.S. financial system is leveraged to the hilt from years of quantitative easing. The mechanism works like this: \n\n1. Authorize a mortgage for a home. \n\n2. Home rises drastically in value due to easy access to liquidity. \n\n3. Reassess value of original home at new value, using the equity generated as collateral. \n\n4. Deploy equity as collateral for another mortgage. \n\n5. Repeat ad-infinitum. (Or until prices begin to fall)\n\nThat's the problem we're looking at: the Fed left interest rates low for too long and now every institution is engaged in low value, long term investments whose profit hinged on a (now) rapidly depreciating asset bubble. Financial institutions can't unwind from these unprofitable investments fast enough, and because many of those investments are becoming unprofitable, so some of their holders are beginning to default. To see what I'm talking about look at the current market for new vehicles. We're talking almost ten-year payment plans for a vehicle expected to last five. \n\nHere's how it all comes together and what you can expect going forward based upon my uneducated musings. \n\n* Following the Great Recession the Fed dropped interest rates to rock bottom to introduce liquidity into a collapsing asset market. This worked. We saw a slow and steady increase in asset prices for over a decade fueled by cheap money. \n\n* That increase in asset prices stimulated economic growth as those who could deployed their assets as collateral to secure additional liquidity. \n\n* New loans based upon rising asset prices instigated  feedback loop which drove asset prices still higher. \n\n* Spiking asset prices lured the financially illiterate middle class into game. If we use  Beenie Babies as an analogy, this is when they hit primetime news. Everyone used their stimulus checks during Covid to buy stock, or put together a nonpayment on a mortgage, or a huge new truck. \n\n* Unfortunately asset prices were already sky-high following a decade of quantitative easing, so many never got the opportunity to enjoy the low interest rates. Yes, a lot of people have three percent mortgages, but a three percent mortgage on a five-hundred thousand dollar house is the same as six percent on two-hundred and fifty thousand dollar house. The principle is too big. \n\n* And with interest rates at rock-bottom, our financial institutions collected payments from the middle class on overpriced assets to drastically widen the wealth disparity. The rich got richer from a few percentage point margins on drastically inflated assets. \n\n* The rich deployed this sudden surge of wealth to invest in inflated assets. You can see this in the percentage of home purchases made with cash. They did this because money sitting around is money losing value to inflation. \n\n* The war in Ukraine and post-Covid supply shocks drove up prices on consumer products, meaning the middle class no longer had the liquidity to spend their income on new inflated assets. They were still making payments, but nobody could save up for a new mortgage. [This is where we saw wealth disparity spike.](https://wir2022.wid.world/executive-summary/) This is because the middle class was making payments on debt while the upper class were continuing to invest. \n\n* Asset prices then experienced hyper inflation because, well, the rich were directly impoverishing the middle class and then immediately deploying that money to secure additional assets. It was a feeding frenzy. \n\n* To stem hyper asset inflation, the Fed began to raise interest rates.\n\n* (Relatively) high interest rates means that few are taking out new loans and the deals made when interest rates are low are finally coming to a conclusion. These are things like construction projects, or mergers which take years of negotiation to hammer out. \n\n* Since people are cutting back and prices are rising, more and more people are taking their money out of their investments to pay for day-to-day expenses. This is introducing a liquidity crunch as for the first time in over a decade people are beginning to 'cash out'. \n\n* Unstable, over leveraged financial institutions collapse due to sudden depreciations in their portfolio. SVB was just the first. They locked enormous amounts of capital in investments with pitifully small returns. This capital is 'engaged' in inefficient investments. They did this because with interest rates so low they quite literally had nowhere else to stick their money. Also they were stupid. (<--- We are here)\n\n* Falling mortgage rates and dropping asset will mean a collapse of the construction sector. If people can't get loans due to high interest rates and lack of return, they won't begin new projects, so people will be laid off. It's going to be 2008 all over again, at least for architects and contractors. \n\n* Rising unemployment and a slow down in the economy will mean people will pull their money out of their assets (houses) and we will see a sudden depreciation in their value. This depreciation will pick up speed as investors realize that if they don't sell soon then they're going to lose a whole bunch of money. \n\n* Falling asset prices will mean the middle class wakes up to the fact that they are in debt to pay off an asset that no longer has the value it held at time of purchase. We can expect defaults at this point. Lots and lots of defaults. This will drag down banks as Mortgage Backed Securities collapse in value. \n\n* My guess is that this is where the Fed steps in to prop up their failing financial institutions. What happens after this is anyone's guess."

Under the Soviet system, people had been indoctrinated for years and the state had ensured most people were in the middle and working classes. They had a mentality where they want to do their 9 to 5, eat their bread, drink and go to sleep while getting benefits and having a voice in how they are treated. It\u2019s understandable, its the working class ethos. \n\nThat mixture of neoliberal capitalist reform, many factory closures, sheer number of working class people, cheap alcohol seems to certainly have been a toxic combination. In the long-term, you can understand why Russians don\u2019t want to play the globalization game- their experience in the 90s was just so traumatic. It\u2019s too bad that Europe was not able to extend more of a hand to Russia at the time, try to bring them into social democracy. But, of course this was impossible."

NBER Working Paper No. 28124, November 2020, https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28124/w28124.pdf\n\nExcerpts from the linked paper:^1\n\n**Abstract**\n\n>This paper studies liquidity risk at the six largest U.S. banks. \n\n>The starting point is the stress tests performed under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) regulation, which compare a bank\u2019s liquid assets to its loss of cash in a stress scenario that regulators say is based on the 2008 financial crisis. \n\n>These tests find that all of the large banks could endure a liquidity crisis for 30 days without running out of cash. This paper argues, however, that some of the assumptions in the LCR stress scenario are not pessimistic enough to capture what could happen in a crisis like 2008. \n\n>The paper then proposes changes in the dubious assumptions and performs revised stress tests. \n\n>For 2019 Q4, the revised tests suggest it is unlikely that any of the six banks would survive a liquidity crisis for 30 days. \n\n>This negative finding is most clear-cut for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.\n\n**The Dubious Assumption About Variation Margin**\n\n>A bank must post variation margin when the fair value of a derivatives contract becomes negative for the bank and positive for its counterparty. The new collateral protects the counterparty from loss if the bank defaults on the contract. \n\n>A famous example is the collateral calls on AIG\u2019s credit default swaps in 2008. These calls were triggered by declines in the values of AIG\u2019s CDS positions due to falling prices for the mortgage-backed securities that AIG guaranteed.\n\n>While it is clear that the LCR treatment of variation margin is unsatisfactory, it is not clear how the treatment should be changed or how much difference it makes for cash outflows at the big banks. \n\n>For each bank, we would like to know (i) the outflows due to variation margin that it currently reports and (ii) the outflows in a more reasonable stress scenario. \n\n>The difference between these numbers would tell us how much the LCR rule understates outflows.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n>The LCR rule seeks to ensure that a bank can survive a run for at least 30 days, providing time for the bank and regulators to find an orderly resolution of the crisis. \n\n>The rule requires that a bank hold enough liquid assets to absorb net cash outflows in a 30-day stress scenario. This paper argues, however, that some of the assumptions in the stress scenario understate the cash outflows that are likely in a crisis and overstate the offsetting inflows. \n\n>Consequently, compliance with the rule does not really ensure that a bank would survive for 30 days.\n\n>This paper also proposes revisions to the problematic assumptions in the LCR stress scenario and uses them to estimate revised LCRs for the six largest U.S. banks. \n\n>The results suggest that all of the banks have LCRs below 100%, which means a crisis would drive them to failure in less than 30 days unless they were rescued by an acquirer or the Federal Reserve. \n\n>This finding is most clear for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.\n\n^1 *Liquidity risk at large U.S. banks*, Laurence M.

Since then, banks have tried to be safer by having more money and not taking as many risks, but there is still a chance that something could go wrong and people would take their money out of the bank again. The author of this paper studied six big American banks to see if they could survive another crisis. They looked at a rule called the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) which makes banks test if they could survive a crisis that is similar to what happened in 2008. The author found that even though these banks passed the LCR test, the test isn't tough enough and the banks might not actually survive another crisis. The author suggests changing the LCR test to be more realistic based on what happened in 2008, and found that none of the six banks would be able to survive a crisis for 30 days. This paper is important because it shows that banks and regulators might not be doing enough to keep the banking system safe, and we need to be careful about trusting them."

Why would demand dry up in an industry with perfect competition given it responds to market forces? It's not as though every supplier of that good would drop what they are doing and move into another industry where they can be more profitable.

But QE was going on for more than a decade prior, and the Federal Reserve had a balance sheet of more than 4 trillion by February 2020. \n\nQE has had disastrous effects for governments around the globe economically, socially, and even democratically as people largely reject institutions in trends in the last few years. It's led to massive economic inequality and insecurity, social stratification, and even a rejection of democratic principles.\n\nEdit: also have to point out just how pernicious this is if true:\n\n>Apparently agreeing with my critique that pure fiscal policy does not result in economic growth unless it is backed by credit creation, Blackrock had argued at Jackson Hole that the \u201cnext downturn\u201d would require central banks to create new money and find \u201cways to get central bank money directly in the hands of public and private sector spenders\u201d \u2013 what they called \u201cgoing direct\u201d, bypassing the retail banks. The Fed knew this would create inflation, as Blackrock later confirmed in a paper which stated that \u201cthe Fed is now committing to push inflation above target for some time\u201d.\n\n>This is precisely what was implemented in March 2020. We know this both from available data and because the Fed, largely without precedent, hired a private-sector firm to help it buy assets \u2013 none other than Blackrock."

We need regional central bank presidents to be democratically appointed and banned from private trading. With regards to SVB its CEO was on the board of directors for the San Francisco Fed which was supposedly overseeing them. \n\n> could be left with a Soviet-style monobank system, where the only bank in town is the central bank. This would be disastrous: the useful functions of retail banks are to create the money supply and allocate it efficiently via thousands of loan officers on the ground across the country.\n\nIt is possible for publicly owned central bank to create credit through local loan offices. In the early United States, the local land loan office system was advocated by Benjamin Franklin to create liquidity for farmers and immigrants. Franklin actually proposed King George create a loan office system where all interest on mortgages was centrally paid to the crown, to be then be paid back to the colonists through colonial infrastructure and the expenses of the British Empire in America, as an alternative to levying stamp taxes on the colonists. He thought this would be a suitable way to avoid the Revolutionary War but his proposal was rejected by the King's advisors.\n\nThe advantage to creating credit through a public banking system to directly compete with private banks is that the interest payments are collected as revenue and can be continuously spent back into circulation on socially necessary expenses without introducing any regressive taxes or causing debt deflation in the real economy. Adam Smith admitted in Wealth of Nations public collection of interest was sufficient to finance much of the budget of the colony of Pennsylvania.\n\nIt's not clear the Soviet comparison applies? In the Soviet Union the major businesses presumably did not directly own the capital or working inventory, and the state was not earning revenue from interest, so there is nothing for lenders to lend against or motive to lend.\n\n> Our empirical study of the US banking sector showed that big banks don\u2019t want to lend to small firms. However, most employment in the economy is with SMEs, which our study suggests will only thrive if we have a decentralised banking system with many small, local banks. In Germany, these local community banks have survived for more than 200 years because they use the co-operative voting system of one shareholder one vote. That system of \u201ceconomic democracy\u201d prevents takeovers\n\nFor public banking ideally the public interest revenue would be split between local, regional, and federal budgets based on the location of the borrower rather than all paid to the federal government, but if the goal is economic democracy it's not clear why relying only on private cooperatives is the ideal. If there's still a central bank lending to local co-operatives there's still a bankers bank which may be lending to non-cooperatives as well."

The liability on a govs balance sheet never really has to be paid back.

The illustrious practice of companies requiring college degrees for jobs that could easily be done by someone with half a brain and some common sense. But hey, let's just make it harder for people to find employment, right? After all, a fancy piece of paper is obviously the most important qualification for, say, pouring coffee or flipping burgers.\r  \n\r  \nIn our modern world, where we love to pretend we're all about inclusion and equal opportunity, degree inflation is a slap in the face. It's like saying, \"Oh, you didn't spend tens of thousands of dollars on an overpriced education? Sorry, not good enough.\" The irony is palpable when you consider that many college graduates are drowning in student loan debt, only to find themselves in jobs that barely require a degree to begin with. Thanks, capitalism!\r  \n\r  \nLet's not forget about experience. You know, that thing that actually shows you've done the job before and are probably good at it. But nope! Companies would rather have a fresh-faced, inexperienced graduate with a shiny new degree in, I don't know, underwater basket weaving than someone with 10 years of relevant work experience but no degree. Makes total sense, right?\r  \n\r  \nDegree inflation also contributes to the oh-so-wonderful \"entry-level job\" paradox. You know the one, where you need a college degree and five years of experience for an entry-level position that pays peanuts. And if you don't have a degree? Well, good luck trying to find any job, let alone an entry-level one, because apparently, a degree is the only thing that matters.\r  \n\r  \nThen there's the issue of people being pushed into pursuing higher education when it's not necessarily the best path for them. Not everyone is cut out for college, and that's perfectly fine. But society has a funny way of making people feel like they're worth less if they don't have a degree. So we end up with countless individuals chasing that piece of paper, wasting time and money, only to realize they still can't find a decent job. Bravo, world. Bravo.\r  \n\r  \nIn the end, degree inflation is a lose-lose situation for everyone involved. Companies miss out on talented, experienced workers who don't have a degree, while job seekers find themselves in a never-ending cycle of debt and disappointment. The only real winners? The universities and colleges raking in cash, laughing all the way to the bank.\r  \n\r  \nSo here's a toast to degree inflation \u2013 the best way to perpetuate inequality, stifle talent, and ensure a lifetime of debt for those who dare to dream of a better life.

But if they want to advance, they usually need a graduate degree.  And the graduate degree often actually IS needed.  \n\nWhat's interesting is how rarely a BS/BS degree really does much for you beyond getting you a position to go to graduate school and get a degree that is essential.  \n\nNow one wrinkle is how a hiring manage (like me) would evaluate a 22YO applicant if they don't have a college degree.  Then I'd want to see some work history.  Like they started out stocking shelves at Wal Mart at 16 and were Senior Stocker by 18 and then junior third-shift manager at 20.  \n\nWhat's really tough right now about hiring 22YOs is I have very little to go on as a hiring manager.  Their bachleor's degree really just gives me some hint at what their high school GPA and SAT scores are (by way of where they went).  And then their college GPA and choice of major gives me some insight into whether they show up, turn in their work, can complete assigned tasks, etc.  But it still doesn't tell me w whole lot about how they'll fare in the workforce.

The idea of going back for a bachelor's, a master's, and contuining to work full time at age 35 just seemed like a waste. So I left. \n\nIt was a big mistake. No job would hire me for any reasonable compensation citing lack of degree yet I had more experience, relevant experience, but would be expected to return to entry level compensation. \n\nI hope this article can be believed that I could find a job commensurate with my former compensation without a degree.  It seems like the article wants me to believe it, but I am just highly skepetical of its reality. The goal is sharehder profits. I hold the belief that maybe, just maybe, they'll take relevant experience without a degree, but not offer a premium. After all, I don't have to pay all that debt back. \n\nMy little soapbox is that, there are so many service and minimum wage jobs that people would be willing to do for a livable wage.  Those are the jobs that really don't need degrees. But man, white collar work is what Americans believe in. I think too many parents have said, \"do you want to flip burgers for the rest of your life?\" Parents are completely convinced that education = wages and this generation has proven it's simply not true anymore."

Imagine a class of people who's wages never grew because there was no incentive to invest in labor, because capitol was allowed to keep the entire increase in production value. Now Imagine a vast ocean of currency with no economic velocity.  Imagine it was allowed to accrue because there was no cap on earning, ie a very high top marginal tax rate. Now Now imagine that stuck currency devaluing your already stagnant wages. Further, try to imagine a system where there is no mechanism for prices to flatten, or for working people to develop a savings. You don't have to imagine it, you just described it to me. \n\nCurrent \"qt\" measures give the game away if you take the time to look at them. \"Demand is too high we have to cause a resession and unemployment by raising rates.\" What that means that we can't even get to peak demand before throwing people out of work. People can't start saving until after peak demand. Flat prices cause peak demand, high top marginal tax rates (read wealth caps) cause flat prices, why make money you can't keep.

Big companies can secure exemptions to export/import rules much more easily as well, critical when we have a new wave of restrictions with China.\n\nIn the case of housing/landlords - rules have incentivized operating as a large company with legal on retainer because that's the only way to survive things like bad tenants in states that make it hard to get rid of them, or a 2 year eviction moratorium. In building construction you're never going to get anything approved without being large enough to already have working relationships with state/local politicians.\n\nHow is anyone supposed to compete with the deck stacked against them?

This is history revisted folks, just not that 2008 stuff....\n\nThe big change we had starting really in the 2000s was the explosion in near frictionless global trade. That allowed economies to significantly overheat without inflation - they simply imported labor in finished goods form. The old economic law of domestic demand = domestic supply was simply negated since (X-M) could be unlimited. But now that's over. We are back to heavy friction global trade. Ergo overheated economies face inflation. It's back to the 1970-90's economy. That is the history people need to remember.\n\nAnd they are starting to. 1980's - ah the introduction of money market mutual funds. The public stampeded into 12% yielding MMkt funds from their puny 5% yielding bank savings accounts. It was the start of real personal finance for many. And today? After being asleep at the wheel because they thought savings always earned 0%, people again are flowing into 4.5% yielding MMkrt funds. The had a word for this in the old days - DISINTERMEDIATION.\n\nDisintermediation is why banks are in trouble. Dems & Repubs talking about lifting FDIC insurance limits completely misses the point.

They thought shadow banks and exotic instruments were the biggest risk. In fact, SVB and others got in trouble in the most boring way possible: investing uninsured deposits in government bonds.\n\nFrom Greg Ip:\n\n>Banks are supposed to be safer than shadow banks because they are tightly regulated. So how could the Fed, which shared oversight of SVB with California regulators, let this happen? The situation was hardly unprecedented: A mismatch between long-term loans and short-term deposits brought down many savings-and-loan institutions when interest rates soared in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Reliance on uninsured deposits precipitated the collapse of Continental Illinois in 1984 and Bank of New England in 1991.  \n>  \n>Conceivably, Fed regulators, like their monetary-policy colleagues, were caught off-guard by how much interest rates would rise because of inflation. Such a scenario wasn\u2019t in the stress tests administered to the much larger global systemically important banks (GSIBs). Even so, banks should have tested for such a scenario on their own.  \n>  \n>Fed supervisors also thought, wrongly, that uninsured deposits were a safe form of funding. \u201cLong experience has taught supervisors and regulators that uninsured deposits from your customers, as opposed to brokered deposits or wholesale short term funding, are rather stable,\u201d said Randal Quarles, who oversaw regulation at the Fed as a governor until 2021. That assumption needs to be rethought, he said.\n\nRead more, free with email registration: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/svb-fueled-turmoil-junks-lessons-of-the-global-financial-crisis-e3240816?mod=wsjreddit](https://www.wsj.com/articles/svb-fueled-turmoil-junks-lessons-of-the-global-financial-crisis-e3240816?mod=wsjreddit)\n\n\\-mc"

The treasury can overdraft its federal reserve account to obtain cash to cover fiscal deficits without issuing debt, then congress can impose a lump sum national property tax which scales in proportion to inflation to suck excess money out of circulation. Ideally a portion of the replacement cost of improvements for non-vacant properties is subtracted from the expected sales price when determining taxable value for purposes of the national property tax to shift the burden to vacant investment units & unimproved land.\n\nWith regards to the Fed oversight, the regional bank presidents needed to be democratically appointed rather than selected by member banks and banned from trading during their tenure, otherwise there is not much guarantee they have the public interest at heart. The CEO of SVB was on the board of directors for the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco."

Including the fiscal impact of those immigrants\u2019 descendants reduces those immigrants\u2019 net fiscal impact to +$57,000.

The type of immigration most common in the US typically involves costs upfront and benefits later. This is problematic for many local governments with limited access to the capital markets or those who may in fact be legally prohibited from running an annual deficit.\n\nMore broadly most people understand immigration as increasing society's population. There are a raft of positive (higher revenues for businesses, potential for more economies of scale) and negative effects (more congestion, higher draw on fixed natural resources) from population increase. These effects arguably are considerably more significant then the NPV of cash flows to government."

Still, they are developing a strategy out of due diligence in case the situation worsens.\n\n\u201cWe will use the tools we have to support community banks,\u201d White House spokesman Michael Kikukawa said, without directly addressing whether the measure is being studied. \u201cSince our administration and the regulators took decisive action last weekend, we have seen deposits stabilize at regional banks throughout the country and, in some cases, outflows have modestly reversed.\u201d\n\nStill, the behind-the-scenes deliberations show there are concerns in Washington\u2019s corridors of power as midsize banks call for broader government intervention after three lenders collapsed this month when uninsured depositors pulled their money, and as a fourth firm strives to avoid a similar fate. Shares of that one, First Republic Bank, tumbled an additional 47% on Monday as industry leaders tried to find a way to bolster the company\u2019s finances.\n\nOne legal framework under discussion for expanding FDIC insurance would use the Treasury Department\u2019s authority to take emergency action and lean on the Exchange Stabilization Fund, the people said. \n\nThat pot of money typically is used to buy or sell currencies and to provide financing to foreign governments. But the fund, created in the 1930s, has been used as a backstop for emergency lending facilities by the Fed in recent years. It\u2019s the only pot of money under the full authority of the Treasury secretary, with other spending and financing under the jurisdiction of Congress.\n\n\u201cDue to decisive recent actions, the situation has stabilized, deposit flows are improving and Americans can have confidence in the safety of their deposits,\u201d a Treasury spokeswoman said in a statement.\n\nRepresentatives for the FDIC and Fed declined to comment. The administration and independent regulators are grappling with the first banking crisis since the passage of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, a sweeping reorganization of the financial regulatory system.\n\n**\u2018Dangerous Precedent\u2019**\n\nThe Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America, which includes banks with assets as much as $100 billion, urged regulators to lift the current cap on deposit insurance, according to a March 17 letter seen by Bloomberg. The organization expressed concern that, if another regional lender fails, more depositors will move their money to the nation\u2019s largest banks, regardless of the underlying health of their smaller competitors.\n\nWhile some lawmakers, including Republicans, have said they are weighing changes to the current $250,000 FDIC insurance cap, a number of House conservatives have come out against a 100% guarantee.\n\n\u201cAny universal guarantee on all bank deposits, whether implicit or explicit, enshrines a dangerous precedent that simply encourages future irresponsible behavior to be paid for by those not involved who followed the rules,\u201d the House Freedom Caucus said in a statement."

Over the past three years the country has lost around 2m more people than it would ordinarily have done, as a result of war, disease and exodus. \n\n>The life expectancy of Russian males aged 15 fell by almost five years, to the same level as in Haiti. The number of Russians born in April 2022 was no higher than it had been in the months of Hitler\u2019s occupation. \n\n>And because so many men of fighting age are dead or in exile, women now outnumber men by at least 10m.\n\n>War is not the sole\u2014or even the main\u2014cause of these troubles, but it has made them all worse. \n\n>According to Western estimates, 175,000-250,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in the past year (Russia\u2019s figures are lower). \n\n>Somewhere between 500,000 and 1m mostly young, educated people have evaded the meat-grinder by fleeing abroad. \n\n>Even if Russia had no other demographic problems, losing so many in such a short time would be painful. As it is, the losses of war are placing more burdens on a shrinking, ailing population.\n\n>&nbsp;\n\n>If you add pandemic mortality to the casualties of war and the flight from mobilisation, Russia lost between 1.9m and 2.8m people in 2020-23 on top of its normal demographic deterioration.\n\n>Most countries which have suffered population falls have managed to avoid big social upheavals. Russia may be different. \n\n>Its population is falling unusually fast and may drop to 130m by mid-century. [The country reached peak population in 1994, with 149m people. The total has since zig-zagged downwards.]*\n\n>The decline is associated with increased misery: the life expectancy at birth of Russian males plummeted from 68.8 in 2019 to 64.2 in 2021, partly because of covid, partly from alcohol-related disease. \n\n>Russian men now die six years earlier than men in Bangladesh and 18 years earlier than men in Japan.\n\n>The demographic doom loop has not, it appears, diminished Mr Putin\u2019s craving for conquest. But it is rapidly making Russia a smaller, worse-educated and poorer country, from which young people flee and where men die in their 60s.\n\n^1 This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline \"The disappeared\", 4 Mar. 2023, https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/03/04/russias-population-nightmare-is-going-to-get-even-worse\n\n*ETA two sentences from the linked content."

Myriad companies have scrambled to find replacements for critical components, like computer chips and more minor items such as shirt buttons.\n\n^1 Mike Eckel, with reporting by Todd Prince in Washington, D.C., RFE/RL, 20 Mar. 2023, https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-economy-imf-forecast-controversy/32326741.html"

They love next to nothing interest rates so people can borrow big money cheaply and buy large volumes of assets, stocks, and in the process their shares go up; whether it's based on good corporate performance or cheap money being borrowed, they'll take it either way they can get it. But it creates a house of cards, and that's why they're so afraid of interest rates going to 5%. The ones complaining about 5% interest rates probably make six-figure incomes, so inflation doesn't really bother them that much; it mostly negatively impacts average-income Americans and below.

It's not fixable via a policy lever like tax rate or income subsidy.\n\nYou wanna reduce poverty? Take some lessons from the one country that actually was successful in fighting poverty - China. Yeah, I know that's a difficult concept for most Westerners to accept. But they were successful. And the one lesson from their success? That there's NO one lesson. China found that to fight poverty, they had to send people down to the local level and deduce causality at a micro level, sometimes down to individual households. No top down solutions. Top down money, yes. But to make sure the money had an impact, there had to be customized solutions for each situation. In some places a new road. In some places free houses to spur relocation. Every place had a different solution. End result - poverty gone."

A group of credit unions agreed to lend to them at rates they offered prime credit risks (with a guarantee from the non profit for the first $5k of any loss) if they completed our program. Car dealers agreed to sell new cars at $100 over cost and used cars at $250 over cost. A quality extended warranty company covered the cars for 60 months for $1,000 apiece.\n\nThe usual cars were entry level Hondas, Fords, Toyotas, Hyundais, and Nissans. Subarus and SUV\u2019s when necessary. In the beginning almost all were new. Over time, we needed to take more certified pre-owned. The average car payment,including the extended warranty, was $300-$350 with a loan term of 36-48 months. That fit comfortably in our clients\u2019 budgets.\n\nOver 15 years no lender lost a cent. The academic studies on the effects on participants\u2019 lives were incredible, etc. Nevertheless, we put the company into hibernation several years ago after issues scaling it beyond 120 clients per month and rapidly rising car prices. The best business schools and management consultants in the country could not come up with a sustainable, self financing model and we tired of fundraising.\n\nWe have never stopped thinking about how to resurrect it and may have come up with a model. However, with car prices and interest rates as they are, the typical car we would be able source now with a payment of $300-$350 over 60 months would be a 2018 Ford Focus with 17,000 miles on it - not a disaster, but not great either.\n\nSadly, we cannot quite get ourselves to a place where we are confident we will not be getting people into difficulty a few years from now. We are weighing a small scale five-year trial (20-30 clients per year). However, the small size constrains the power of the exercise and means significant fundraising. / grant writing for the program\u2019s costs.

In fact owning Treasuries and MBS is fine. But the banks blowing up own the wrong kind. In particular they own securities with significantly higher duration (interest rate sensitivity) than they should have. Author does come close to identifying this issue, but simply says: Banks borrow short and lend long. No. Incompetent banks borrow short and lend long. Now it may be the number of incompetent banks is higher than anticipated, but there are plenty of small and regional banks that had adequate asset liability management and didn't fall into this trap.\n\nAs an aside, I spent 20 minutes today looking at the 10-K of a small local bank that my elderly parent has far too much money deposited in. They were fine! Total unrealized loss on Held to Maturity portfolio was equal to 3% of total equity. Compare this to SVB which had unrealized loss on HTM portfolio equal to about 115% of total equity. This is why they were seized. They were functionally insolvent given heavy deposit withdrawals were going to turn those unrealized losses into realized losses in days.\n\nSo to answer the question posed by the article's title: The Problem With Interest Rate Shocks - It Kills Off Stupid People Who Run Stupid Banks."

They \"print\" money (conceptually, not print-proper like the mint?) and give it to banks (with interest rate) in exchange for the banks crappy assets? And then what does the Fed do with those crappy assets? It's kind of confusing because it it talked about like actual goods and services, but it doesn't work that way. Thanks in advance."

As interest rates rise, the price of these bonds must fall. Why? \n\nBecause they make fixed payments, so if you pay $1000 today, a 1% bond will pay you $10/year until it matures, then you get your $1000 back. If interest rates jump to 5% tomorrow, what happens to that bond? It still only pays $10, but now everyone can go out and buy bonds that yield 5%, which means the price of the original bond must fall dramatically. \n\nMBS = Mortgage Backed Security. A financial instrument who\u2019s cash flows are \u201cbacked\u201d by mortgages. The payments that come in from a bunch of mortgages bundled together are paid out as dividends to investors who buy these."

                    "CommentBody": "This is an old article. References stuff that the market sort of cared about 2 years ago. Very little relevance to current market at present.\n\nHowever to answer the OP's question: There are two entities you need to be aware of. They are the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank. \n\nThe US Treasury collects revenues (mostly taxes) and uses it to pay the bills of the US Government. It also conducts some housework related to paying bills. For instance it will collect worn out paper currency, withdraw it from circulation and replace it with new paper currency. Does this with metallic currency as well, but obviously less frequently as it is more durable. Since the US Treasury prints these new dollar bills, amongst lay persons, there has developed the belief that the US Treasury can just create additional money by printing it. This is false. US Treasury is not allowed to create additional currency. What the Treasury can do however is borrow money on behalf of the government. Why would it do this? The usual reason - the government wants to spend more money that it receives as revenue. This is a habitual occurrence and the way the Treasury borrows money is that it sells an IOU to investors. The money from the sale of the IOUs is spent by the government which thereafter needs to pay interest (and eventually principal) on the IOUs. The IOUs come in many forms, but the most common are marketable securities (i.e. tradable between investors), colloquially known as Treasury securities. These in turn come in sub-categories: Treasury bills (1yr or lower maturity), Treasury notes (2-10 years to maturity at issuance) or Treasury bonds (10+ years to maturity at issuance). However often times you will hear lay people refer to the entire set of Treasury securities as Treasury bonds. Not accurate, but whatever.\n\nOK so what does the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed for short) do? If manages and supervises all federal chartered banks in the US (the vast majority of banks in the US are federally chartered). There are some other government agencies that claim some supervisory rights over banks (FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, etc.) but honestly they all rank far below the Fed in functional control. Additionally the Fed is charged with the management of monetary policy in the US, this includes the management of money supply and the level of interest rates. Thing is Fed can't actually directly control all those things. But it can very strongly influence them. One of the most common ways it does this is by buying and selling the Treasury securities we talked about above. For example, let's say the Fed buys $10 billion of the current 10 year Treasury note. Well these days that note probably had $35-40 billion issued. So if the Fed were to buy 25-30% of those notes, obviously the price of the notes would go up. Supply and demand, right? And if the price of a fixed income security goes up, then the yield goes down. So by buying Treasury securities the Fed can influence interest rates to decline. Now there are a lot of other effects that occur relating to money supply, bank reserves, etc. but the article cited by the OP mainly concerned the first effect - the effect on interest rates by Fed purchases of marketable securities.\n\nOK we've talked a lot, but we're almost done. Mortgage backed securities (MBS) are marketable securities that receive cash flow from loans made to individuals (mostly) who borrowed to buy a residential home. This is a big market. About equal in size to 60% of the Treasury market. And about a third larger than the corporate debt market. Again, large Fed purchases of MBS will tend to raise their prices and decrease yields. It can thus influence interest rates.\n\nWhat does the Fed do with the Treasuries and MBS it buys? It licks them and sticks them to a really big wall. OK, not really. It holds them and collects their interest payments. And when the principal of the debt comes it, it takes that too. Now there are a slew of side effects to the Fed buying this stuff, but that's for another day. OPs main questions are now answered and OP should have the background info for further discussion if he/she so desires."
