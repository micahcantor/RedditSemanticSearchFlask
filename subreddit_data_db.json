So perhaps the better approach is to use a simple common set of HTTP codes, not requiring anyone to look up obscure codes, and put all the nuance needed in JSON. As we were."

If I had an idempotent response I could call delete and if I get back a already deleted response I don\u2019t need to do anything. \n\nThis is extra helpful if that action was way a create,  if I was deleting and creating and the create came back as already created - I could throw because that\u2019s unexpected.   It gives me the option. \n\nAll these super niche status codes and idempotent responses which are super common aren\u2019t in there.   400 status codes aren\u2019t idempotent and you need to handle the failure cases.\n\nWorse is most api owners don\u2019t know how you will use their api so they will code up 404 responses on deletes and thus nearly every delete api requires special handing for idempotency."

The difference now is that the borders are open, you can just leave rather than choosing between defection, getting a bullet, or just doing your job.\n\nThis country was once in a space race with the US.

It literally is just a country that metajabaits on propaganda supported by raw materials as well as agriculture. There isn't really any high tech coming from Russia in the last 30 years. Cars? Well, where?\n\nRussia has been gutted by the siloviki mafia since decades and now they transfer it to China. \n\n\"warn that the country is well on its way to becoming a village\"\n\nThat was the plan. The siloviki mafia pulled through with it. It's North Korea 2.0. No way to change that as long as the siloviki mafia is in charge. Time to move on.\n\n> \u201cIt felt like my country was stolen from me,\u201d says Igor, \n\nYeah. Most russians don't understand what the siloviki mafia did there. Propaganda oddly\nenough works.\n\n> When the war began, he says, he felt as if 20 years of Russia\u2019s future had been\n> taken away in a heartbeat.\n\nThat makes no sense. Why 20? Why not 50? That's an arbitrary number.\n\nThe theft by the siloviki mafia ONLY holds up IF they remain in power. Now right now\nit looks as if they will continue to rule, but it's not an automatic guarantee. Dictatorships\nrarely ever give up on their power. It's actually worse than in the soviet union because the\nPolitburo had some modicum of control of the power, whereas Putin and his siloviki mafia\nturned Russia into a fascist state (de-facto) that can only sustain itself by constant warfare.\n\n> In Russia, technology was one of the few sectors where people felt they could succeed\n> on merit instead of connections\n\nThat's absolute rubbish. These articles seem to try to retrofit history. WHICH technology\nfrom Russia has been world-dominating in the last 30 years, that came from the SOFTWARE\narea please? Which one exactly? Hardware? What exactly?\n\nThere is none. That so many IT folks left will of course hurt Russia, but to insinuate that PRIOR\nto that things were epic, is just rubbish.\n\n> For a time, the Kremlin seemed to embrace this openness too, inviting international\n> companies to invest in Russia.\n\nRussia is a potemkin village. Putin planned the invasion many years ago already. It did not\nstart in 2022, it did not start in 2014. I think it came heavily due to NATO invasion of Yugoslavia in 1999 actually, since that was the test-bed for NATO what they can do with its own military.\nSince then it seems to me as if Putin was out for revenge. Of course he claimed the opposite when he was younger, but KGB clowns always lie, so anyone buying into their lies is foolish.\n\n> Isolation became a strategic choice, he says.\n\nYep, Ruben is absolutely correct there. The real question is WHEN that decision was made.\n\nI do not buy for a second it was made \"spontaneously\" in 2022. Too many decisions had to be made here, so this HAD to be prepared a long time ago. I also doubt it began in 2014 either - that was just a decoy for russian expansionist agenda. I am pretty certain it started already before 2000. Perhaps it was not planned 1:1 as outcome as-is, but I have no doubt about Putin whatsoever. People don't seem to get him. Simply listen to Vlad Vexler or Otto Habsburg (in 2003) who already stated that Putin's rhetorics is hugely similar to Hitler before 1938. Lo and behold, look at what happened. Some people CAN predict the future based on their own prior knowledge and experiences."

It just promises that if you send A, B, and C, that if C arrives, A and B will have arrived first, in order. \n\nThat\u2019s it. \n\nAnd it does that, reliably. If you think it promises more than that, that\u2019s on you. The fact that it has error codes for connections disconnecting is a great clue of that. \n\nSo the advice that should really be taken is twofold:\n\n1) as a consumer of an abstraction, understand what promises the abstraction is making. \n2) as the producer of an abstraction, don\u2019t promise things you can\u2019t deliver."

OS changes UI style? All its AppKit windows and controls do too. OS implements dark mode? All the AppKit windows and controls support it automatically. About the most arduous thing one might have to do is add dark variants of custom colours (if you weren't just using the defined system colours, which all switched automatically) so that they worked on a dark background.\n\nSo here I was, with this uninformed opinion: All the portware authors are there making life \"eaiser\" (very heavy air quotes) by having to do any and and all of that stuff themselves; constantly chasing updates to the OS UI style (or just not bothering and leaving the apps looking weird and outdated), or any other changes related to the likes accessibility or just general presentation. It all falls to lowest-common-denominator; system restore, Services menu, document versioning etc. are all in the 'probably-not' bucket unless you're using the system APIs where it's all for-free or nearly-for-free. Nothing like that exists on other systems so it generally won't exist on cross-platform toolkits, or application authors won't know/care about it because they've not used a system with - again, heavy airquotes - \"advanced\" features like that.\n\nSome of that is right, but it's also wrong: It's only when I look at how crude the *functionality* of predominant MS Windows GUI toolkits seem to be that any of it starts to make sense (despite often a very large API and apparent complexity). It's just that **you don't know any better**. The native toolkits in Windows appear to have made it just as hard to do super-crazy-hard-wow-mind-blown stuff like dark mode (sigh) or HiDPI as if you'd used a cross-platform toolkit and often, the APIs are so rank and the changes or abandonment of things so aggressive, that you're *better off* with the cross-platform stuff. There's a good chance it's actually got a cleaner, better API and quite possibly *more* functionality - in some respects - than the native APIs for the OS you were using, because the toolkit authors have put huge amounts of work into layering stuff on top.\n\n(But not if you come from macOS, where all that stuff just looks janky, crude, typically rather bloated and all very feature-poor compared to native stuff).\n\nSo the XP toolkit apps aren't really just shitty portware for macOS, borne of ignorance. It could well be more a case of it just being *far less unpleasant* to use that toolkit for Windows as a primary target and then, after that, why not tick the Linux & macOS boxes in the build system, so you get a larger market share and other people can at least enjoy the software in *some* form? Defo had my attitude about it all wrong.\n\nBut the part I think is still right is that it's *incredible* how poor most UI toolkits are, to this day, on the majority of platforms and how OS after OS, application after application, it's just a confusing mess of independently drawn controls, all linked into each application with great big lumpy libraries, rather than just calling out to the OS to have something drawn consistently by the system framework."

It's the Win32 subsystem that converts the kernel's simple (if verbose) paths into the familiar drive-letter-based scheme.\n\nUnix-like operating systems generally don't have a layer like that. Such operating systems' kernels see paths exactly as the user sees them. This was one of the many ways Mac OS X broke compatibility with classic Mac OS: Mac OS X is BSD-based and uses plain old Unix paths, whereas classic Mac OS file paths used `:` as a separator (instead of `\\` or `/`) and were drive-based like MS-DOS and Windows (but used the whole volume label as the drive name, not a single letter).\n\nMicrosoft, by contrast, is highly averse to breaking backward compatibility (much to the joy of retro gamers and overworked IT people everywhere), and kept the old-style paths, even if only as a user-space illusion.\n\nApple did keep one little bit of nostalgic legacy, though: the default volume label for a Mac's internal storage is still \u201cMacintosh HD\u201d, even though Apple stopped using hard disk drives (and, for the most part, the full name \u201cMacintosh\u201d) years ago. [The icon even fairly realistically depicts a hard drive, complete with Torx screws and a warning label about damaging the imaginary device's circuit board.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ipod/images/0/08/Macintosh_HD.png/revision/latest?cb=20200731072939)\n\n>: \tDisallowed except for with data streams\n\nOr drive letters (`C:`), or MS-DOS devices (`CON:`). The colon has been banned from file names ever since MS-DOS, long before NTFS and alternate data streams were introduced.\n\nDevices have the colon at the *end* of the path, though, whereas alternate data stream paths have a colon in the *middle* of a path component. MS-DOS was overzealous in forbidding colons entirely, but as you can see, this left Microsoft an opportunity later on.\n\n>UNC paths have a peculiar way of indicating the drive letter, we must use `$` instead of `:`.\n\nThat's not actually part of UNC, per se. Rather, the Windows SMB server automatically shares each drive, and that's the naming convention it uses for these automatic drive shares. You can see them using `smbclient` from the Samba suite, and these automatic shares don't exist on Samba servers.\n\n>Note that `\\\\Pipeline` is not a valid directory path in itself, as it only identifies a server. The name of a share must be appended to arrive at an actual folder.\n\nFun fact: the operating system doesn't consider that a valid path, but File Explorer *does.* It will show a listing of all shares on that server.\n\n>A `.` is fine anywhere within, or at the start of, a name, but is disallowed as a final character.\n\nThis, too, comes from MS-DOS. On MS-DOS, *all* file names have an implicit dot in them, separating the file name stem from the extension. The extension can be the empty string, but this only means that the dot is at the end of the file name instead of in the middle. If you give a file name with no dot in it, MS-DOS pretends you added a dot at the end.\n\nAnd yes, that applies to folders. The Windows 3.1 \u201csystem\u201d folder's default path was canonically `C:\\WINDOWS.\\SYSTEM.`, and it could indeed be addressed that way.\n\n*Why* did MS-DOS have separate file name stem and extension fields, then? I don't really know. My first guess is so that it can easily search for `COM` and `EXE` extensions, and thus quickly find and execute commands, but I dunno. The old IBM PC was pretty slow, but it wasn't so slow that it couldn't split a 12-byte string around the dot in a reasonable time.\n\n>That\u2019s what sticking to a policy of total backwards compatibility for several decades gets you!\n\n\u2026I mean, so did BSD, and its paths still look exactly like they did in the '80s. They're just null-terminated bags of slash-separated bytes, same as they always were. The only incompatible changes I can think of are the changeover to UTF-8 and the introduction of the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, but neither of those is actually enforced like Windows path conventions are.\n\nI think the real reason for all of Microsoft's path weirdness is that MS-DOS was designed to be a command-line interface for non-tech-savvy business users, who would have been confused by things like case sensitivity and mount points. Not an issue now that GUIs are ubiquitous and file paths are constructed mainly by point-and-click, but it very much was an issue back in those days. Unix, by contrast, was mainly used by IT professionals and nerdy students, who could handle such things just fine, and macOS was a GUI from the very beginning."

Then, directories were added. For backward compatibility with users and programs saying just `foo.txt`, concept of current working directory and relative file paths needed to be added. Also, reserved names such as `con` or `prn` now worked in all directories.\n\nThen, Windows NT came with completely different architecture. It uses the device paths. It uses NTFS. It uses Unicode in form of UCS-2, later extended and renamed to UTF-16LE, yes Unicode in 1993. For backward compatibility it also needs to support things such as relative paths. Current working directory is not a thing in WinNT, it is implemented inside Win32 sub-system, a compatibility layer on top of NT. Another sub-systems were OS/2 and POSIX, none of them survived until today, only Win32 did, WSL is not a sub-system, it is something completely different.\n\nSo, relative paths, case sensitivity and 260 characters length limit are Win32 thing, not NT thing. NT can work with paths up to 32k Unicode UTF-16 code units (beware, there is difference between code unit and code point), that is, with path lengths up to 64kB. Also, the path can contain almost any gibberish, even unpaired UTF-16 surrogates, good luck converting this into UTF-8.\n\nAlso, files can be accessed with their old style 8.3 names. There are hard links, junction points, symbolic links, files inside volume shadow copies. Data stored inside files' ACLs (hehe). And many other things I don't know about."

In other words, anyone who complains about bias in Chat-GPT is actually complaining about humans. This is especially obvious when they're complaining about bias against political candidates who lost their most recent election because the majority of (human) voters think that candidate is shit. Just like democracy, it becomes a problem when the majority of humans suck; and (if history is anything to go by - slavery, women's rights, perl, ....) humans do suck for many decades until society changes.\n\nThe reasons you can't trust Chat-GPT are that it can't be reasoned with, can't learn, and it hallucinates nonsense. This is what makes it \"worse in theory\" than humans - there's always a chance a human will learn and improve, but if Chat-GPT insists \"1 + 2 = 6\" there's no chance it'll improve and you have to resort to \"murder\" (killing off the old version and replacing it with a newer hopefully better version).\n\nOf course the other problems are that OpenAI is a \"for profit\" company with major funding concerns (I fully expect that subscription fees will fail to be profitable and they'll eventually resort to spamming everyone to cover the cost of regular retraining), and there's unresolved legal concerns (with respect to copyrights, etc of the training data); where mitigating the second problem (e.g. paying StackOverflow for training data) costs $$ that makes the first problem harder to solve. Ironically; it's these problems that make me distrust OpenAI far more than any \"reflected bias in humans\" ever will."

            "body": "The article is somewhat ... weird.\n\nFor instance:\n\n> If I where the package maintainer of Firefox in a BSD project or Linux distribution, it\n> would be my responsibility to track the development of Firefox.\n\nI remember having had arguments with debian maintainers. They tend to change the\ndefault ruby installation e. g. removing mkmf and removing other things (or rather \nremoving them AND putting them into a sub-package most new users don't even know\nexist). So then a new user installs the debian ruby, but tons of things don't work and\ncompiling add-ons (from C bindings) does not work UNLESS you de-cripple the default\ninstallation. So these maintainers make the life HARDER for newcomers. That was one\nreason why things such as rvm, chruby, rbenv and so on became popular, since it was\neasier to manage multiple different versions as well as overcome issues that these\ndistribution maintainers create. And on top of that each linux distribution just loves being\nincompatible to other linux distributions.\n\nI think this is really horrible. Not all distributions suffer from that (slackware does not \nbother to make arbitrary top-down changes, so that is very different from debia), but\nonce they do, it causes problems for downstream users.\n\nSo the statement \"track the development\" simply omits that these package maintainers\noften do additional changes. Some of these changes are beneficial, such as using \npatches to make old code still work with modern GCC and what not (LFS/BLFS is doing\nthat too, you can find tons of patches there). But often these maintainers also simply\nchange things arbitrarily and then don't give an easy way for users to disregard that.\nOr does anyone know of a simple command to tell debian to NEVER split a package?\nWhile also allowing you to search the database by the very NAME (or just giving an\nURL as-is)? For instance, today or yesterday there is a new mesa release at: https://mesa.freedesktop.org/archive/mesa-23.0.3.tar.xz\n\nSay I want to have that. I now have to wait until someone packages it up. Why do I have\nto wait? If I want to compile it from source on my system I do \"trad https://mesa.freedesktop.org/archive/mesa-23.0.3.tar.xz\" and it will be downloaded,\nthen compiled via the /usr/ prefix (trad is an alias I use for \"compiling traditionally\",\nand traditionally means /usr/ as default prefix). For managing multiple different versions\nI use a scheme that is somewhat similar to GoboLinux (I'd wish I could use something\nlike nix from nixos, but I don't like having to learn a new language merely for a package\nmanager).\n\n> It would also be my responsibility to make sure any provided patches that make local\n> changes to Firefox, such as the location of binaries, etc. works as they should.\n\nLFS/BLFS is doing that too, but with the added benefit that it is not deliberately incompatible\nto other distributions. I feel all distributions should be like that - teach people, rather than\nassume they know everything. It's ok if people don't WANT to know everything, then they\ncan just rely on auto-upgraders, but IF they want to know, it should be explained and made\neasily available. Just as LFS/BLFS does.\n\n> A responsibly maintainer will notify the proper channels of his decision to abandon a package,\n> but as you know, not everyone is a responsible person.\n\nSounds like awful debian bureaucracy.\n\nI much prefer LFS/BLFS or slackware (even though the latter kind of is very slow these days\nin regards to regular updates).\n\n>  On Arch Linux every package\n\nYikes - so not even debian. The Archies have become more bureaucratic than debian ...\n\n> This also means that being a package maintainer on a BSD project or a Linux distribution\n> involves a certain amount of trust. On most projects you cannot simply become a\n> package maintainer over night.\n\nBut you have that problem with ALL code. Can I trust all the Linux kernel code either?\n\nNot everything must be malicious. People sometimes do stupid things.\n\n> In any case, all of this shows that you should be careful when you choose which\n> project to use as your favorite OS.\n\nNah, I stick to LFS/BLFS or the slackware approach. It may mean more additional\nad-hoc work, but I don't depend on upstream maintainers that do their own things\nI may not like to have. (systemd is a wonderful example here)\n\n> Regular and timely updates for the web browser or email client is very important.\n\nI am using thorium these days. I just download the releases from the github page\n(I am so lazy). I find myself doing that increasingly more with software. It's almost\nas if github became a replacement for a package manager (well, at the least in \nregards to the code that is offered there).\n\n> Others have very few people involved and lack the proper resources to become\n> a serious distribution\n\nSo why is a one-man distribution not \"serious\"? Because it takes more people? For\nwhat service, actually? And that service is then necessary?\n\nI get that more eyes are better than fewer eyes, but this assumes that mass alone\nmakes for better end results. And this is not always the case. Quite the opposite,\nI often found having a motivated tech-lead helps a LOT. Many projects benefit from\nthat more than multiple people with only low motivation or skills. I am not saying\nthis is always the case so, and many projects grow over time naturally (see Linus\nfrom his \"won't be big\" email to today), but I don't understand why a distribution\nwith more people automatically means the end result will be better. \n\n> When you choose your OS, it is hence a really good idea to look into these\n> things before you make up your mind.\n\nI don't think that works well. Slackware has rarely any reviews or use cases\ndetailed these days, but usability wise I consider it among the best linux\ndistributions. But it is only on rank 37 on https://distrowatch.com/ and admittedly\nit slowed down a lot in the last 10 years. But using it is so much better than,\nsay, using ubuntu. It's not solely the fault of slackware - the whole software\necosystem has gotten a LOT more complicated in the last 20 years ... just\nlook at the whole LLVM+clang stack these days. Good luck trying to get mesa\nto work without LLVM."

Otherwise comments like \"the user should be held responsible\" make little sense, as one problem that should be adressed is the user not having enough information to make meaningful choices.\n\nNeither does it seem to be the case that these problems are already solved by current product liability laws, as a lack of security updates seems to be brought up in many circumstances on tech forums, be it phones, iot or other systems.\n\nPeople also seem to underestimate the loopholes they are asking for. While thinking about it, it seemed difficult to me to come up with excemptions that are not easily applied to many business models to skirt any liability. Once you come up with a solution, try to put yourself in the shoes of a software or hard+software company and think of how much trouble it would be to use that excemption. e.g., only sell hardware and give out your software for free.\n\nCalling the makers of those rules uninformed, while most participants of the threads display huge misunderstandings of the rules and problems, is unfortunately not as funny as I would like it to be.\n\nNot to call the rules perfect, they are not and have serious threats for many important things (to my understanding especially package repositories). But I'd personally like to see not only \"that is bad\" respondes, but ones actually adressing the issues, proposing solutions that do not make other techies scream \"what uninformed dounce came up with this.\" \n\nUnless you think those problems do not exist, the go ahead :)"

Donations don't count, getting paid by the new OSS funding organizations doesn't count. The wording is pretty explicit here.\n\nSecond, the law does not make the developer liable for every bug, issue, or user incompetence. It makes the developer liable for security exploits in the software they are commercializing. It is extending software strict liability to explicitly cover security exploits. This increases the pressure to vet included code, and code you have written to ensure security exploits don't exist.\n\nWhy is this needed? Supply chain attacks have been occuring at increasing frequencies. Currently, the only company held liable in the event of an exploit is the company that got exploited, Even if the exploit was in a library they included. With this update, the exploited company will STILL have a share of the liability, but so will the company that offers the library in a commercial context. Why does this matter? Because the individuals most capable of reviewing and verifying any code, are those that work on that code regularly. There has been a sort of wishy washy approach to security in OSS up to this point, and you can continue to operate like that and take donations through Patreon if you wish. This law say that if you're going to offer the software in a commercial context (including offering a support service for the software YOU develop), you are going to be liable if that software has security vulnerabilities that get exploited (another critical aspect is that an incident has to occur for there to be any liability).\n\nWe can all agree that the trend of companies using end-consumers as beta testers is both annoying and should be pushed back against. The debate is whether OSS companies should also be held to that same standard.\n\nHonestly, this seems like a fair approach. If you want to commercialize the software, you need to do your upmost to make it secure. This will spur the creation and maintenance of new tools, languages, and technology to avoid, fix, and stop security exploits. Finally, a balancing of liabilities would still occur. The proposal does not make OSS companies the ONLY liable party, it just makes it so they share on the liability in the case of a breach. The relative sizes of the entities involved would be taken into account."

I suspect lobbyists keep trying to force it but the various government legal people say, \"This just won't pass constitutional muster.\"\n\nIn my city, the property developers entirely own the local government and are highly influential with the regional government. Banks are extremely influential with the federal government. I suspect they have both hired a lobbying army which could minimally be described as a horde.\n\nOf course there are other powerful players such as pension funds who are going to be joining said horde.\n\nOne other factoid in Canada is something we have called REITs; Real Estate Investment Trusts.\n\nThese gems were originally purposed for people of good means but little collateral. The platonic example is 5 doctors who would like to invest their money in a small apartment building; they are clearly capable of paying the mortgage from their earnings and the bank is loth to loan any real-estate money to some nubies in the form of a limited liability company. So, the doctors set up a REIT which is mostly like a LLC but doesn't limit their liability. If the company \"defaults\" on the loan, the doctors have to pay up.\n\nAround the turn of the century these REITs became wildly popular in Canada for much larger companies; even going beyond real-estate. But there are some massive apartment and other commercial real-estate companies which are REITs. They are very large and have been paying significant dividends (something REITs are pretty much forced to do by their nature). So, many a boomer piled money in starting over 20 years ago and are very happy with their retirement income. \n\nBut, if what this article is saying comes to fruition, there may be many a sad boomer who not only sees their REIT dividends dry up, but they might be sent a whopping huge bill if it turns out some of these REITs end upside down on their loans in a big way. Plus, given the nature of the real-estate business, what are the chances one or more of these REITs has played fast and loose with accounting rules and has squirrelled away a pile of debt, hidden from their balance sheet. I'm thinking some mini-enrons with their Chewcos and whatnot.\n\nIn the reasonable number of boomers I've talked to about their investments nearly 100% had a REIT in their portfolio. Exactly 0% knew there was any liability exposure.\n\nI can see a pile of boomers then joining the lobby army screaming how they aren't liable for these debts. Seeing boomers actually vote, I can see the government mopping up this debt for them; especially since a major holder of REIT investments are the giant pension funds."

Happy to expound further if needed) and the marginal revenue - in this case marginal revenue is just price because they have no pricing power - aka your return for the sale of each item.\n\nSo really the company just has to decide how many units to sell given the price in the market. If I told you that I\u2019ll pay you $1 for as many apples as you\u2019ll give me and the marginal cost of apples for you is (in order of production) $.80, $.90, $1.00, $1.10, how many apples will you sell me?\n\nThe answer is 3 apples, because at each of those levels you turn a profit or at least get your money back on each Apple sold, but the 4th Apple costs you more money than you will get in return. \n\nSO you (the producer) have a logical incentive in a market where the price is known to only sell up to the point where the cost of the unit (MC) is at most equal to the price (MR).\n\nHope this helps!"

If a government doesn't need educated and healthy citizen to extract those ressources, the gouvernement is incentivized to just do the bare minimum and capture the wealth. If they don't there might be a coup in which the wealth will be captured by another group in the country.\nAnd companies and countries that want to extract this wealth will be sure to pay whoever government or warlord is willing to give a concession. \n\nWithout accounting for the fact that natural ressources create a rent for whole economy. With workers getting better pay if they work in national ressource based industries. And leading to more ressources in that industries. And in the mainwhile less ressources would go to long term wealth inducing industries like manufacturing. Which anyway would be made uncompetitive with the rising exchange rate driven by the natural ressources industries. \n\nFor developing countries, such as Chile, that need capital to develop their manufacturing industries. And especially if they are somewhat democratic. It is important to nationalize the natural ressources industries, acquire the industries and knowledge, by going up the value chain. And capture most of its rent to invest in industrial manufacturing, security, education and roads. No private actors are willing to do that. And this can turn a ressources curse into a long term successful development strategy.\n\nEdit: I just realized that people on r/economics don't really care much about the economic science.

He grows a lot of their food, plus they have solar and well water, so are able to save quite a bit more.\n\nAnother retired with a small pension, wife has a bigger pension, house is paid off, money in savings; they travel a lot, and do a lot of hiking.\n\nAnother never worked (housewife); has social security through her husband plus inherited a ton of stocks from her father (who was very talented at making money that way). They have two paid off houses (one their son lives in).\n\nAt 66, I am still working (I acquired a remote job that I enjoy during the pandemic); I don't have to work but every month I delay social security is another $120 a year plus $500 extra in my 401K. I have a fairly good pension and two tiny pensions which will cover all my bills if I am very careful. My social security will be my cushion (once I take it), and my 401K isn't huge, but it is my emergency/travel money. My house will be paid off in 2035 if not sooner. My only other debt is the solar I put on my house and I will have that paid off in 7 months.\n\nI have acquired a companion, and we've moved in together (his house). I am likely not going to sell mine because I know I will likely not be able to buy another and I do not want to marry again (it's never worked out for me); my companion isn't in the best of health and I will likely outlive him. So my nephew is living in my little house and caretaking (he pays utilities but no rent) in hopes that he can save enough money for a better start in life; when/if he decides to move out, I will figure out something else.

If adopted, it would reverse a loosening of rules by the Fed in 2019 and heighten oversight of midsize banks by extending restrictions that currently only apply to the largest, most complex firms.\n\n>All told, regulators are considering extending toughened restrictions to about 30 companies with between $100bn and $700bn in assets, the people said. A proposal could come as soon as this summer, and any changes would be phased in, potentially over a couple of years.\n\n>Regional banks such as US Bancorp, PNC Financial Services Group, Truist Financial and Capital One Financial could be affected, and could be made to bolster capital. That could prompt steps such as trimming buybacks, retaining more earnings or raising new capital from investors. \n\n>Banks are planning to fight rule changes.\n\n^1 Andrew Ackerman and Rachel Louise Ensign (21 Apr. 2023), \u201cFed rethinks loophole that masked losses on SVB\u2019s securities\u201d, The Wall Street Journal/News Corp., https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-rethinks-loophole-that-masked-losses-on-svbs-securities-4cc7f762"

            "body": "Hey this is one of the few times I called the ball and was right. In December (and earlier!) the writing was on the wall if you're big into banks and I'm currently, unfortunately a tad overweight banks/financials.\n\nIn early December I had a meeting with my US financials coverage and saw this shit, it was obvious some cat 3 and 4 banks were positioned like idiots, some were hidden due to AOCI rules being changed by the Orange asshole (you can opt-out, how fun!). Hilariously my coverage was resolute that maybe some tiny regs were coming in mid-23, but he discounted my problems.\n\nAnyway, the main problem here is how this is regulated, how bank categories are filed and how we view them, the entire paradigm is aged and out of date.. They have been trying to get better but its too little too late, here's what I'm on about: traditionally we have categorized banks in terms of money [as seen here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/files/tailoring-rule-visual-20191010.pdf) but obviously if you have two braincells to slap together you know that's not enough and banks are complicated as fuck. What the regs are trying to do and needed to have done and why this was an easy call is that money is only one side of it, we call G-SIBS globally systemically important, well so are regionals or 'super-regionals' which is the new term I'm trying to get into the common vernacular. These larger regionals like USB, PNC, Truist, are all geographically systemically important, similar to SVB who largely deals in the bay area, those other banks are far more diversified but not as much as say a WFS or JPM or larger banks. In their selected areas these banks ARE systemically important, and in SVB's case they also weren't diversified in client type, they all were high value tech start ups or VC firms, making SVB more of a hedge fund than a bank really. So really we need to expand what we're actually looking at regulatory wise, we do need to look at AUM sure, but we also need to look at who their client base is, where are they located, what are their core competencies? Whats fucking stupid is the stress test requirements aren't there for these 'little' guys, how did they not hedge vs a 4.5 interest hike, sure it was fast but you're a bank for christ's sake. These stress tests need to be updated for local problems on top of the normal shit, is their a local industry like tech that is a substantial portion of the depositor base? okay so stress that industry, drop if off a cliff, what do our ratios look like now? \n\nUSB, PNC and Truist should face more regulations because they're super regionals, or quickly becoming them, USB recently finished a acquisition of an MUFG sub, making it a pretty serious player. USB, PNC and Truist are pretty safe, their avg account balance is solid, they actually have a fucking risk office (cough SVB) and they're well capitalized, their LC and CET1 ratios are pretty good, USBs looks ass because of their acquisition, it'll get better. If USB or PNC ate shit it'd be a big fucking problem. Really we just need to unchain regulators and to get people in who actually know banks and more importantly, are cynical assholes, my bank coverage wasn't a cynical asshole, we pay him well and he didn't see it coming."

The housing market had a surprisingly strong February, when sales rose a revised 13.75% from the previous month. But after mortgage rates ticked higher, March sales resumed the extended period of declines.  \n>  \n>The housing market\u2019s slowdown is now starting to weigh on prices, which have fallen on an annual basis for two consecutive months for the first time in 11 years. The national median existing-home price decline of 0.9% in March from a year earlier to $375,700 was the biggest year-over-year price drop since January 2012, NAR said.  \n>  \n>Median prices, which aren\u2019t seasonally adjusted, were down 9.2% from a record $413,800 in June. Home prices in the western half of the U.S. experienced some of the biggest gains for many years but are now falling the fastest.  \n>  \n>The U.S. housing market has slowed dramatically in the past year as rising mortgage rates, high home prices and persistently low inventory frustrated buyers.  \n>  \n>March\u2019s home sales declines don\u2019t bode well for the spring season, which is usually the most active time for home sales because families with children often want to move homes between school years.  \n>  \n>A cooling economy, with stubbornly high inflation and the prospect of recession in the next 12 months, is keeping some buyers on the sidelines.

If the sale price of the home went down 10k, but the interest rate on the mortgage added a percentage point, buyers are still worse off. Lets say you put down 40k on a 200k sale price home, so you need a 160k mortgage. If you take a 30 year mortgage, an extra 1% in interest is an extra 30k in interest payments. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2020 you could get a mortgage with an interest rate around 3.25%.  Now its more likely to be 6.25%.  So if you're buying a house and you see \"wow! this house listed at 600k in 2020 but now I can buy it for 570k. Sweet! I'm so smart for waiting!\" but then take out that 6.25% 30 year mortgage. Oh wait, you're paying 90K more in interest than you would have before.  You can potentially refinance in the future if rates come down. But if you look at a historical chart its not like 6.25% is some obscene number that can't stick around for a long long time. If anything the abberation is the 3.25%. I'm inclined to believe the economy is so addicted to cheap money that rates will be slashed eventually, but its far from inevitable.  \n\n\nWith the increase in interest rates, its possible for the sale price to go down, but the buyers cost to go up even more than it was before, so now both buyer and seller are losing out, and the only winner is the banks."

Here, license plate readers and tow trucks mix with sun and golf into a heady cocktail for these uneasy economic times. With more Americans struggling to pay their bills, the $1.7 billion industry for repossessing such assets as cars, trucks and boats is gearing up for a boom. The effects are expected to reverberate through countless ordinary lives and onto Wall Street, where car loans are packaged into bonds and sold to investors.\n\nIt\u2019s a major shift from the pandemic years, when relief measures for consumers meant repos largely dried up, leaving many agents out of a job. Now repossession companies are struggling to find enough workers to meet repo requests. \u201cAs the economy curves down, our industry curves up,\u201d says Ben Deese, vice president at North Carolina-based Home Detective Co. and a member of the American Recovery Association, the industry group that hosted the Orlando conference. In March, the percentage of subprime auto borrowers who were at least 60 days late on their bills was 5.3%, up from a seven-year low of 2.58% in May 2021 and higher than in 2009, the peak of the financial crisis, data from Fitch Ratings show. While not all of those borrowers will face repossessions, the risk is high.\n\nIn many areas around the US, having a car is a necessity, especially where public transportation is nonexistent. Many will face difficulties getting to work or taking care of kids without a car. As car prices soared during the pandemic, in part because of supply chain issues, some had no choice but to sign on to loans for high-priced cars with high interest rates.\n\nFor Sarah Fader, a freelance writer in New Haven, Connecticut, fear of a repossession is constantly on her mind. After totaling her car in 2021, the 43-year-old single mom of two teenagers had to get another, fast. But with a credit score in the 500s, she struggled to find a lender who\u2019d approve her. She finally got a 2016 Subaru Crosstrek for $26,000 with a 19% interest-rate loan from American Credit Acceptance, with a monthly payment of $630. That quickly became unaffordable as costs of food and gas rose, putting her behind on rent and the car payment. Fader has tried to raise money by crowdfunding on Twitter but still owes more than $1,000. \u201cNow they\u2019re threatening to repossess my car, and I\u2019m scrambling to come up with back payments,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t have a solution for them, and I could not function without a car here.\u201d\n\nLenders are eager to make loans, even with the risk that the borrower might not be able to make the payments. That\u2019s because car loans, like home mortgages, can be sliced up into bonds and sold to investment firms, hedge funds and other investors. According to calculations by ratings agencies, investors in the safest parts of today\u2019s subprime auto bonds would still get their money back with interest even if more than three-quarters of the borrowers defaulted on their loans, assuming repossessed vehicles can be sold at auction for a modest share of their original prices.\n\nOne of those recently came for Richard Sanchez. The 36-year-old, who works as a technology director at a San Francisco company, had his Toyota Rav 4 seized in January after failing to make the monthly $750 payments. In September, the rent for the home he shared with his wife and two kids rose 10%, to $3,700 a month. Although Sanchez took on a second job packing orders at Amazon Fresh and recently moved to a home with a $2,800 monthly rent, it was too late.\n\nLuckily, his family also owns a 2001 Nissan Altima outright, but they\u2019ve struggled to get around without a second car. \u201cOnce our cost of living was going up, I was doing my budget and was like, \u2018I don\u2019t have enough money for the payment,\u2019\u201d Sanchez says. \u201cIt\u2019s made me feel pretty horrible. I had a pretty bad depression last year because of it.\u201d"

I feel kind of bad for her but this was simply a terrible decision on her part a $26k car with a 19% interest rate for a desperate single mother is one of the worst financial mistakes I've ever read no wonder her credits in the 500s, and after all that she uses crowdfunding?  \n\nShe got a $630 a month car payment as a FREELANCE writer and single mother?

Selling 4 year old cars on a 7 year loan was always going to be a problem.\n\nI wonder how many of those loans actually get retired by the buyer and what happens then.  They then have an 11YO car with a lot of miles.  It's not worth a whole lot, so they don't have much to trade in.  So they're probably financing their next car also.  \n\nAt some point, it's not much different than leasing.  \n\nAnother thing that occurs to me is that cars are so much better than they used to be.  The powertrains will almost run forever if properly maintained.  But the auto industry hasn't really innovated much on service.  It's still \"bring your car to the shop\".  It might be the dealer or a private shop or a Jiffy Lube.  And everyone hates that because they always try to fix other things for a lot of money that the owner suspects aren't really necessary.  It's inconvenient and expensive.  \n\nOwning these aging cars could be a LOT better.  I wonder if it's something that will improve as the auto makers get away from their relationships with their dealerships.  So instead of going to a Toyota dealer to get your car fixed, you'd be dealing with something else."

Many of the auto sales over the last couple years occurred in an environment where auto prices were greatly inflated. Cars historically are depreciating assets. Combine this with expected falling prices in general could be a problem.\n2. Auto loan terms have increased in length recently (96 months for an auto loan is crazy). This means people in general have less equity in their vehicles.\n3. During the pandemic an interesting thing happened with credit scores- they overall went up (from 703 in 2019 to 714 by 2021). Now, this isn\u2019t because people all of a sudden got smart with money, but rather than there were all these capital injections and other policy introductions that helped consumers. Now people could pay all their bills and increase their credit score. This allowed people to access financing who otherwise would not qualify in normal economic times.\n\nTake these factors- elevated auto prices, lack of equity due to extended terms, and credit score inflation, and all it would take is a drop in auto prices or a mild recession to cause massive problems in the auto loan industry."

But as far as reduced competition in the market, lack of liquidity to survive swings of the market? Arguably. \n\n>How long can the American consumer subsidize their daily life on high interest debt? \n\nWe're only a year into \"high\" interest debt. Assuming when you say subsidize you mean pay more for debts than they currently earn: Some people can bleed money for years, some people can't bleed money for months.\n\n>What could happen if the \u201dconsumer debt bubble\u201d were to pop?\n\nAssuming by \"popping\" you mean \"default on debt\": The University of Sydney Business School did a study on consumer debt where they found that the order for defaults is:\n\n1. Depleted Store Credit Cards\n\n2. Unsecured Personal Loan\n\n3. Depleted Credit Cards\n\n4. Non Credit Checked Loans\n\n5. Investment Home Loans\n\n6. Utilities\n\n7. Secured Loans/ Car Loans\n\n8.

Short term: Reduced demand of goods/services, increased supply of goods, reduced price of goods/services. Long term: Overall reduced economic growth.\n\nBasically assuming the consumer debt bubble stops at \"wow I'm sure overpaying for that car, I'm going to have to give it up and get a cheaper one\" then I imagine that we'll just see a mild recession."

Since then, China has shaken the world by creating more wealth than any other country in history. While India, too, has picked itself back up in the three decades since it liberalized its economy, it remains well behind in many of the most basic scales.\n\n> Today, China\u2019s economy is roughly five times the size of India\u2019s. The average citizen of China has an economic output of almost $13,000 a year, while the average Indian\u2019s is less than $2,500. In human-development indicators, the contrast is even sharper, with infant mortality rates much higher in India, life expectancy lower and access to sanitation less prevalent.\n\n> The divergence, analysts say, comes down largely to China\u2019s central consolidation of policy power, serious land reform, an earlier start in opening up its economy to market forces starting in the late 1970s, and its single-minded focus on export-led growth. China took the first-mover advantage and then compounded its dominance as it pursued its plans relentlessly.\n\n> India started opening its quasi-socialist economy nearly a decade later. Its approach remained piecemeal, constrained by tricky coalition politics and the competing interests of industrialists, unions, farmers and factions across its social spectrum.\n\n> \u201cThere is that element where China is a natural role model \u2014 not for its politics, but for the sheer efficiency,\u201d said Jabin Jacob, a professor of international relations and governance studies at Shiv Nadar University near New Delhi.\n\n> The world now has a radically different power structure than it did in 1990. China has already made itself the world\u2019s factory, all but closing off any path India could take to competitive dominance in export-driven manufacturing.\n\n> A \u201cMake in India\u201d campaign, inaugurated by Mr. Modi in 2014, has been stuttering ever since. Wage costs are lower in India than in China, but much of the work force is poorly educated, and the country has struggled to attract private investment with its  restrictive labor laws and other impediments to business, including lingering protectionism."

First, it seems to have the right institutions in place to sustain democracy in the long run, so that's definitely a key advantage over China. Sure, the rise in right wing nationalism is a concern, but if Indian democratic institutions survived the Emergency era under Indira Gandhi, this doesn't seem that bad. Its population also will be stably growing until 2065(sure those forecasts might be inaccurate but at least into the near future we can expect sustained population growth). That's another key advantage. The disadvantages would primarily be its heavy overregulation of many key sectors, the lack of transparent institutions, the affinity for protectionism, and the  heavy subsidisation of agriculture which is a drag on the economy and prevents the labor force from shifting to more productive manufacturing and services jobs. The last point is a key one because as long as farmers remain a key and major voting bloc, politicians will keep protecting them, and that will sustain their size as a major voting bloc, turning into a self reinforcing loop that will keep India trapped under the chains of being a low tech agrarian society. In the urban areas though, we've seen an interesting shift towards services, high productivity and high paid services jobs, for example in the financial sector of Mumbai, which serves as the financial capital of the country. What this has meant is that India has sort of \"skipped\" the industrialization phase that most countries go through on the path to development, with significant parts of the population employed in agriculture and services and a relatively lower proportion employed in manufacturing and the secondary sector in general."

Whatever bullshit propaganda and fear mongering these crypto blogs try to peddle, their wishful thinking will never materialize until the U.S. union is no more. because IMO, that will be the only thing that will unseat the dollar as reserve currency. the dissolution of the union.\n\nif you need more proof, just watch where investors run to for safety everytime there's a recession. they don't rush to BRICS to safeguard their money.\n\nso can we just ban these mfn threads on this mfn sub? i'm tired of them. they provide nothing new, and their arguments are lazy, tired, and stupid."

At the same time, the relationship between current inflation and inflation expectations has strengthened.\n\n>&nbsp;\n\n >I highlight three main results for the period from 2021:Q1 through 2022:Q4. First, trend PCE inflation has risen above the 3.3 percent historical average for quarterly annualized PCE inflation, and hence it is well above the 2 percent long-term inflation target, with the most recent estimate of trend inflation in 2022:Q4 being 3.4 percent. \n\n>Second, with the increase in trend inflation, the Phillips curve slope has risen slightly above its prepandemic level, implying that monetary policy is able to have slightly more powerful effects on inflation than in the prepandemic period. \n\n>Third, with a high level of trend inflation, the relationship between inflation and inflation expectations is stronger than its historical average, but I find that short-term inflation expectations matter more for current inflation than do longer-term inflation expectations.\n\n>Together, these results imply that even though a slowing economy would help to bring down inflation through the steeper slope of the Phillips curve, high short-term inflation expectations could put upward pressure on inflation to a larger extent than they had prior to the pandemic.\n\n^1 Ina Hajdini.

Larry Kudlow, the head of the former president\u2019s National Economic Council, said it would boost GDP so much that it would \u201cvirtually\u201d pay for itself. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, went further, saying the tax cut would \u201cin fact create additional revenue.\u201d\n\n> This was fantastical nonsense; tax cuts rarely if ever pay for themselves. But the Congressional Budget Office gave the Trump team\u2019s sales pitch one important boost: The agency ran the bill through its model and concluded that it would have a positive, if muted, effect on long-term growth. Most Republicans were going to support Trump\u2019s bill no matter what, but now they could do so with a straight face.\n\n>The CBO\u2019s relatively sober prediction was wrong, a group of respected economists is charging. The Budget Office, along with other forecasters, assumes that when corporations get a tax cut, they take some of that money and reinvest it in their business, boosting growth and productivity. That assumption ignores a central dynamic of today\u2019s economy: Many sectors are dominated by a small number of huge companies.\n\n>Much has been written over the past few years about the rise of corporate concentration. The Biden administration has made fighting monopolies one of its key economic-policy priorities. Yet none of the leading economic models takes consolidation into account. This is more than a purely technical concern. The risk is that conventional modeling is misinforming policy makers, Republican and Democratic alike, on how to structure policies that affect everyone. Governments may be relying on models that are too stuck in theory, too slow-changing, and too simplistic to be truly helpful.\n\n>\u201cThe existing models do not work well, particularly in the moments when it really counts,\u201d such as a financial crisis, Joseph Stiglitz, the former chief economist for the World Bank, told me. \u201cThe underlying economics, the assumptions that go into the economics, are very badly flawed.\u201d\n\n>Stiglitz is an adviser to American University\u2019s new Institute for Macroeconomic & Policy Analysis, an initiative to update those assumptions and improve those forecasting tools. Today, IMPA is launching a new economic-forecasting model that researchers believe better captures how the economy works and, by extension, how policy changes will really play out.\n\n>Competitive economies and monopolized economies behave very differently, economists have found. When there\u2019s plenty of competition, corporations tend to plow money into their business, investing more in research and development or raising worker pay to attract talent. But if a company doesn\u2019t face much real competition, the pressure is off\u2014it can simply pass the extra money along to shareholders. A model that ignores this distinction might be suitable for a tidy theoretical economy, but it won\u2019t match the messy one we live in.\n\n>In the inaugural paper using IMPA\u2019s model, the economists L\u00eddia Brun, Ignacio Gonz\u00e1lez, and Juan Montecino conclude that the Trump tax bill was \u201charmful to the economy\u201d\u2014it slowed down growth and amped up inequality. Slashing the corporate-tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent did not boost workers\u2019 wages by thousands of dollars a year, as Trump appointees had predicted. Nor will it boost GDP in the long term. The IMPA model finds instead that cutting the corporate-tax rate \u201creduced the funds used for productive investment\u201d by shunting money into investor payouts. What\u2019s more, it suggests that raising taxes on business monopolies might stimulate growth by lowering those firms\u2019 stock-market returns and thus spurring investors to pour money into more dynamic businesses.\n\n>The relationship between corporate-tax rates and business investment is a fiercely debated topic among economists, and some forecasters I spoke with didn\u2019t think that rising corporate concentration was causing them to overestimate the economy\u2019s growth. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, who did not work on the IMPA project, told me that concentration shows up indirectly in other variables commonly included in big forecasting models.\n\n>That said, several forecasters agreed that conventional models rely on questionable, even laughable, assumptions. Some models, for instance, assume that the country has perfectly competitive labor markets in which workers have total freedom to switch jobs and are paid precisely what they\u2019re worth to a company\u2019s bottom line. And the models generally don\u2019t account for the ways in which having markets dominated by so few competitors\u2014Google with web search, Amazon with online shopping\u2014might skew profits, investments, and wages. \u201cThe assumption that there\u2019s no market power is just wrong,\u201d Stiglitz told me. \u201cIt\u2019s so obvious. In many sectors of our economy, we don\u2019t have anything that approaches that level of competition.\u201d He cited the tech sector, drug stores, even dog food.\n\n>Creating the new IMPA model to account for monopoly power in the United States was a three-part process, Montecino and Gonz\u00e1lez told me. The researchers first constructed a complex mathematical model capturing a variety of factors that contribute to growth. They then tested it against historical data, seeing how well it would predict the 2015 economy using financial numbers from 2012, for instance. Finally, they let other economists critique it and review its predictions.\n\n>One of those economists was Kimberly Clausing, a tax expert at UCLA School of Law. She said that she appreciated the attempt to make a model that accounted for enormous companies\u2019 outsize power. \u201cThings look different when things get hyperconcentrated,\u201d she told me. \u201cLook at the economy of the 1970s, when there was less concentration. The labor share of income was higher. Investment was higher. So many of the main macro variables performed differently.\u201d\n\n>Many of the forecasters I spoke with mentioned that forecasting is just plain hard\u2014and something economists have not gotten much better at in recent decades. Chris Varvares of S&P Global Market Intelligence, a forecaster with decades of experience who is not affiliated with IMPA, noted that the economy is enormous and complex. Impossible-to-predict events, such as the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine, happen all the time. Even the world\u2019s most influential economists often disagree on what causes what. \u201cThere\u2019s not always good data,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s just something we have to live with.\u201d\n\n>That said, IMPA\u2019s economists stressed that rising corporate concentration has profoundly changed our economy over the past several decades. It seems past time for it to also change how we model the economy."

The Congressional Budget Office gave the Trump team a boost by running the bill through its model and concluding that it would have a positive effect on long-term growth. However, this assumption ignores the rise of corporate concentration in many sectors. The Biden administration has made fighting monopolies one of its economic-policy priorities, but none of the leading economic models take consolidation into account. This risks misinforming policy makers on how to structure policies that affect everyone. Joseph Stiglitz is an adviser to American University's Institute for Macroeconomic & Policy Analysis, which is launching a new economic-forecasting model that better captures how the economy works and policy changes will play out. The IMPA model finds that cutting the corporate-tax rate \"reduces funds used for productive investment\" by shunting money into investor payouts, and suggests that raising taxes on business monopolies would be beneficial in the long run."

Okay genius, where do shareholders shovel this extra money? It's not like they're hoarding loads of cash down their pockets like fucking Scrooge McDuck are they? No, they shovel that cash into buying shares in other companies that they think are performing better, essentially a transfer of capital from less productive to more productive aspects of the fucking economy. Or they spend that money on themselves, which increases consumption(which also boosts growth, genius). \n\n>Labor share of income was higher\n\nYea, it got replaced by capital, due to the advancement of technology. Productivity growth has remained relatively linear so this clearly isn't a bad thing. It's just that this productivity is passed on to consumers in the form of cheaper products, not in the form of overarching wage growth. And while I hate Trump beyond belief, it's well known consensus that corporate taxes are one of the most harmful types of taxes due to their distortionary effects on the market and them being a major cause of capital flight. I can't believe a bunch of dumbass takes were also highly upvoted in this very thread. Jesus Christ."

Financial sanctions restrict entities\u2014countries, businesses, or even individuals\u2014from purchasing or selling financial assets, or from accessing custodial or other financial services.

This comes across that it\u2019s perhaps a moral imperative to increase the income of thoee around the world because it will directly lower human suffering (pain). I think the concept of happiness/reductions in suffering being tied to material wealth is really, really, really incorrect. Happiness is a psychological state as well, and sure, material comfort can bring happiness in the form of short-term pleasure, but material wealth does NOT solve the issue of unhappiness.\n\nThis is part of my frusturation with how the UN defines poverty. The lack of access to credit is not violative of human dignity, it just evidences a lack of materialism."

This article focuses on underperformers, but my hypothesis would be that there is a similar but inverse (meaning positive) effect (although probably less severe) on high performers in each region as well. If this hypothesis is true, then it isn't really that \"comparison is the thief of joy\" - which would suggest comparison makes everyone unhappy - but rather that success and failure of participation in a competitive marketplace has a deep impact on our psychological experience. Phrased this way, I don't think the results are really surprising at all. Are world champion athletes happier than their less succesful counterparts? Do athletes on losing teams experience more \"physical pain\" than those on winning teams? I think the natural assumption to these questions is clearly yes. The only move I have made here is to characterize income rank as a competitive marketplace, which is how I have always personally conceptualized it anyway."

These findings supported Hypothesis 2 of this study. These results also suggested that a one-unit decrease in income rank (i.e., moving from the top to the bottom of the ranking) increased physical pain (on a 0-1 measure) by 0.102 (10.2 percentage points).\u201d\n\n\u2026. that moving from the highest to the lowest socioeconomic status only accounts for a 10.2% increase in reported pain. \n\nMy takeaway from this is: as a share of the total pain caused by poverty, relative poverty causes more pain than absolute poverty. however pain is mostly caused by other factors. So I think both sides of the argument in this thread, paradoxically, are right. income inequality causes pain regardless of absolute income . However lower socioeconomic condition in general is not the largest factor in determining pain."

You\u2019re not a victim. \n\nEdit: just to further emphasize the point- when adjusted for cost of living, average salaries for coastal states don\u2019t actually out class those in the interior even though the sticker price is higher.\n\nWhen adjusted for affordability from average salaries, Massachusetts is beaten by Iowa, Washington States is Beaten by Missouri, Oregon is beaten by Alabama, and Hawaii, California, AND New York are beaten by West Virginia.\n\nEdit 2: people arguing that salaries on the coast ARE high enough despite evidence to the contrary. I don\u2019t even want to argue. Either the article is wrong and making 300k IS enough in NYC to offset the costs so you shouldn\u2019t complain; or the article is right and the rat race salaries don\u2019t justify COL.

Even if you only buy a \"crappy\" million dollar house, that house is worth a  ton which you can later sell for a ton. When you retire and move to a more cost friendly area you can use that equity to live like a king.\n2. You can get a much larger 401K match at your company due to your location inflated salary. This will also allow you to max out your 401K every year which will allow you to live much better when you eventually move.\n3. You can also max out your IRA. 6-7K is nothing when you are making a 300K salary. Once again, this all drastically helps you in the long run when you go to retire and move to a more cost friendly area.\n\nYou have a choice, you can live in a cool fun place with lots of restaurants, culture, etc, and pay a premium for it. Or, you can move to a smaller town and get a lot less of all that but at a reduced price.\n\nIt's also pretty shitty to say \"It's like I'm ONLY making 100K\" as if 100K isn't a ton of money in most parts of the USA. I live in what most of the country would call a shitty city and if you make 100K here, you can easily buy a house and have a very solid upper middle or even lower upper class lifestyle.

If we include other institutions\u2019 reactions, it also matters whether an institution holds asset classes held by institutions that hold asset classes that banks also hold.\n\n>To examine these derived effects, we simulate a second round of fire sales within our framework, where we now consider the losses incurred by every institution type to each of the first-round fire sales, and the resulting second-round fire sales. \n\n>&nbsp;\n\n>The second half of the above table shows the impact on banks from the aggregation of second-round fire sales. Mutual Funds (Bonds) are the highest ranked as vectors of shock amplification. Within our framework, corporate bonds are the most broadly held asset class and thus a firesale concentrated in bonds has a large second-round effect. \n\n>The second to fourth rank are now taken by mutual funds (equity), pension funds, and once again life insurance companies.

There's a lot of necessary regulatory hurdles to build something like that safely. Meanwhile, solar and wind can just be thrown up anywhere - the biggest concern is NIMBY complaints from locals. The technology is available and ready to go, while most modern nuclear plants are still essentially prototypes.\n\nThat being said, I think nuclear is still important long term. In particular, we need grid stability - big turbines that keep spinning through inertia such that the voltage and frequency remain stable during grid upsets (large loads switching on and off).

This is neither the case for fossil fuels nor the case for nuclear power. Nuclear power uses fuel rods that run out and need to be disposed off. The fuel rods are a finite energy source and the waste requires specialized bunkers for storage. The waste is a small part of the problem. The biggest problem with nuclear energy is the long start up time before a nuclear reactor runs on full power. It takes on average 10 years from building to operations. This means that building new reactors now won't add anything until 2033. So nuclear is a long term solution and not a short term solution. This means nobody us willing to invest in this since renewavles are growing fast. Fear mongering in the 80's and 90's made sure it never became a reliable energy source and the direct result is the huge energy prize increase in Europe when Russia was no longer a viable supplier of oil and gas due to the war in Ukraine.

It requires an army of plumbers and skilled tradesmen to keep the thing running. Related to the previous point, they rarely make much profit.

Someone who knows what the team is supposed to do, has our back outwards, and motivates us to do good work inwards. Whenever you have *that*, productivity skyrockets. It doesn\u2019t really matter where or how you work, if people feel heard, respected, motivated and appreciated, they will give all that they can. Good leadership is essential for any kind of productivity equation\u2026 which is why bad leadership constantly ignores it and refuses to accept its importance. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if I work in the office or at home, if I feel motivated and that the work I do matters and gets recognized, I\u2019ll put in all the effort I can muster. But if not, I can piss my hours away of coffee breaks and talking with my colleagues at any office you want. It\u2019s not going to matter much *where* I am."

This obviously takes some time, since commercial leases tend to be 5+ years, and there's a bunch of infrastructure in the offices that needs to find a home elsewhere, but it's going to save the company a ton of money in the long run.\n\nHonestly, I don't understand why some companies are fighting remote work so hard. Several years of covid showed us that there wasn't a net loss in productivity, and there are huge potential cost savings from not paying for offices, and since (let's be honest) companies aren't going to pass those cost savings to employees, that means more profit. Why would companies not want more profit?"

A nine-year-old Michigan boy spends so many nights watching YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat videos that he ends up uploading a nude photo of himself that goes viral. An 11-year-old Connecticut girl deals for two years with an extreme addiction to Instagram and Snapchat before spiraling into insomnia and depression that leads her to take her own life. \n\n>These harrowing cases, reported last year by Bloomberg, are among hundreds of private lawsuits filed against social networks in recent months.\n\n>Two hundred of them have joined together in a class-action lawsuit. Filed in the Northern District of California in March, the lawsuit charges that Meta (for Facebook and Instagram), Snap (for Snapchat), ByteDance (the company that owns TikTok) and Google (for YouTube) are seriously harming the mental health of young Americans. \n\n>The process is currently in the pleadings phase. The U.S. Supreme Court is due to decide in June whether the lawsuit goes forward or is dismissed.\n\n>This newspaper has contacted the four technology companies to inquire about their position on the process. All of them have declined to comment specifically on the lawsuit, beyond assuring that they are taking steps to strengthen content control.\n\n^1 Manuel Pascual (22 Apr. 2023), \u201cThe wave of lawsuits that could kill social networks\u201d, El Pa\u00eds, https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-04-22/the-wave-of-lawsuits-that-could-kill-social-networks.html\n\n^2 *Complaint*, https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Redacted-Master-Complaint-1.pdf"

Because they can make money. They know it harms the public. But money. Money. Money. Money. Zero accountability. \n\nUnfortunately because of the money, it\u2019s highly unlikely that accountability is in their future. \n\nMoney>children=America  and it\u2019s embarrassing. \n\nGuns, social media, politics, big pharma, us normal average people stand no chance. We have no say in the world we live in. Our voices are not heard by the people who elected to represent us. Big industry is the only voice that has influence. It is absolutely heartbreaking. \n\nI have a doctorate, own a business, and am surrounded by amazing people, but I feel powerless when it comes to my future. The decisions that will determine how my life plays out are not being decided by people who care about me and those around me, they are being decided by corrupt politicians and shady industry. \n\nSo yes social media\u2019s profit margins are what politicians should care about. Didn\u2019t they just have a hearing for twitter where the politicians only cares about their own engagement and following?

I saw Amazon\u2019s grieve for years from the loss of their owners. One died from a broken heart (that\u2019s when I stopped volunteering. I did everything to save that bird. She wanted none of it).\n\nI met birds who carried on conversations with me. One sang the Batman jingle just to me, no one else. An African Grey when you asked  can you say hello? He would say can you fly? No one taught him that it was just him being cheeky.\n\nSo what do we do? Put them in cages with no stimulation. Cut their wings so they can\u2019t get away. Typically their first owner dies and they are shunted around after that (Amazons can live over a hundred years and most large parrots can live easily well over forty years). \n\nIt\u2019s beyond cruel. It keeps me up at nights as it\u2019s the same as throwing a curious eight year old in a cage so small they can\u2019t stretch their arms out. \n\nIf you\u2019re thinking yes but I have to have a parrot someday. Stick with parakeets, and Cockatiels, which are intelligent too but seem to do reasonably well in captivity with a caring human. They typically only live around twenty years. We make affordable large cages so they can keep their wings and have some stimulation. \n\nBut the big ones? Please don\u2019t, you\u2019re destroying a life and they\u2019ll get to be traumatized for a very long time. And if you have a parrot and this enraged you? You\u2019re lying to yourself and you know it."

Sure, replacing a Chromebook screen might be $80 and nearly half the cost of a Chromebook, but replacing a screen on a Windows laptop will probably run the same if not more.\n\nThe idea is that Chromebooks are cheaper and more disposable/replaceable. Repairing laptops have a cost to them as well, not just the cost for the parts, but time and labor. And you have additional support cost of it being Windows. Chromebooks require far less support than a Windows machine does."

That's $12,000,000 in Chromebooks alone, let alone software and time spent managing them. Good luck getting 3-4x that approved for a competent, longer lasting Windows or Mac laptop - but of course only officially supported\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, both Windows and macOS given about 6-9 years of OS support and security updates for the most part, so it's not like that's too little for Chromebooks, that's the standard most devices get today. And yes, I know patchers and installation tweaks are a thing but you don't do that in an enterprise or education/government environment. ChromeOS Flex is also a thing, and you can patch linux onto Chromebooks. No way in hell we're doing that either. I'm not against more repairability (Socketed SSDs and RAM might be nice), but Chromebooks are about as repairable as any other Windows laptop and WAYYY more repairable than Macs.  \n\n\nThis article may be well-intentioned, but it's based on bad assumptions.

As the IT guy I loved the Macs, Apple has so many backend tools for educators and IT admins it really made my job so much easier. From fixing problems, adding software, restricting games and sites, any IT problem they just had a tool for it. \n\n  Then the pandemic measure started to wound down, schools re-opened and the MacBooks were traded for those horrible clunky bits of plastic they call Chromebooks. Imagine being in a tiny closet I called my office, surrounded by around 300 Chromebooks, all needing setup. I wouldn\u2019t wish it upon my worst enemy. Needless to say a year later a good 30% of those Chromebooks were back in my office and heading to the e-waste bin.

Prevent such powerful technology from being accessible to people that have no culpibility. No reputation to uphold, no public accountability. Bestowing incredible power to no name people, so they become powerful terrorists. That is the opposite of what you want. Governments should carefully monitor, control the supply of super computers, and control access to AI secrets to limit their spread. You can't stop people from using power for abusive purposes, but you can limit the access of it to people that are more likely to abuse it. Governments can collaborate to keep AI out of the hands of dangerous people. Everything from licenses to bans, is on the table, we can work to keep AI out of the hands of everyone and anyone we don't feel should have. That isn't subject to public scrutiny, and regulations. Countries that don't regulate will suffer the most from that lack of regulation. The AI empowered criminals will strike in their home country first.

It should be noted that no lithium mining takes place next door to homes and schools, but common sense and logic are not prevalent among the fossil fuel crowd.\n\n* Lithium (at $80,000 per ton) is more difficult and expensive to get at compared to sodium ($300 per ton).  Making it insanely cheaper!\n\n* Both are very abundant and chemically similar, so sodium is an obvious choice for an alternative.\n\n* Sodium-ion batteries are less energy dense, though this is set to improve.  They're at the performance level that li-ion were at 10 years ago.  This means less space, as more of them are needed.  They're also less affected by low temperatures and can handle more charge/discharge cycles.\n\n* Companies will introduce cars with a combination of lithium and sodium batteries.  At the Shanghai auto show this week, CATL said its sodium-ion batteries will be installed in the Chery iCAR due to go on sale by the end of this year, according to CnEVPost.  BYD sources say its sodium-ion battery will also be in mass production in the second half of the year beginning with the Seagull. BYD introduced the Seagull in Shanghai this week.\n\n* Prices will range from $11,450 to $14,000.  Capacities will range from 30.08 kWh to 38.88 kWh.\n\n* Sodium-ion batteries are of great interest in grid level energy storage, as space isn't an issue there.  \n\n* America controls >90% of readily available sodium source (soda ash)."

Sodium-ion batteries also seem to, like lifepo4, have safety advantages over traditional lithium-ion.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the main downside of sodium-ion as compared to lifepo4 is that their cycle life is maybe half that of lifepo4, but that still puts it as several times better than traditional lithium-ion, so that's not really a roadblock either.\n\nThis article indicates that sodium-ion batteries will probably be worse for the environment, though, since China will control most of the market and will produce synthetic sodium ash in a very dirty fashion."

Additionally, calcium is abundant and inexpensive, which makes it a potential candidate for large-scale energy storage applications.\n\nHowever, calcium-ion batteries face several challenges. One of the main challenges is finding suitable electrode materials that can reversibly insert and extract calcium ions without significant structural changes. Another challenge is developing suitable electrolytes that can support calcium-ion transport with high efficiency and stability.\n\nCompared to sodium-ion batteries, calcium-ion batteries have the potential to offer higher energy density and improved safety due to the lower reactivity of calcium ions compared to sodium ions. However, sodium-ion batteries currently have a more mature technology base, with more extensive research and development efforts and a wider range of available materials.\n\nIn summary, while calcium-ion batteries offer potential advantages in terms of energy density and cost, significant research is needed to develop suitable electrode and electrolyte materials before they can become a viable commercial option."

I think Linux Lite is great, but it's a deal breaker for folks that struggled to accumulate working knowledge of Windows or MacOS. Switching operating systems for them is asking them to start over, and the frustration would be a deal breaker. \n\nAs for the folks that need more computing power, I recommend a refurbished macbook pro from Amazon Renewed. I hate to recommend Amazon to anyone, but this is a good idea. I needed to buy a laptop 3 months ago, and I went with a renewed 2019 macbook pro. 2.6Ghz Intel i7, 16gb ram, 16\" display. I'm a developer running servers and emulators locally, so 16gb felt like a requirement. It comes with a 90-day warranty, which is usually plenty of time to see if a tech gadget is hosed. Because they have so many, if it is bad, you can just get another one. I paid $980 for a 2019 laptop instead of $2500 for a new macbook. \n\nThey have some pretty strong Windows laptops too, but you have to do your research on which ones have a more durable case. I had an MSI gaming laptop which was amazing, but after a few years, the metal hinges broke through the plastic of the display bezel and destroyed the laptop.\n\nRenewed is good for phones too. I've bought a couple of them that way. Almost the same price as buying used locally, but there's a warranty and replacement process.\n\nDisclaimer: I do not work for Amazon, do not like recommending them, and would gladly use a comparable alternative."

It seems fair to me that if you sell a product you should design it from the get go to be long lasting. It should not go to e-waste just because of no updates while the hardware is still good. In the past you can make an argument you can reuse but now with everything glued, sealed and miniaturized...it's just trash.\n\nOfc there should be a cutoff, a maximum number of years (5-10 years) and after that, the last update make it so that you change the code to remove company secrets(aka code you still use) and replace it but have the same function and make it open access so that person can keep it alive if needed.\n\nExample i have a 11 years old laptop, works great, added some ssd and ram and it's a great travel laptop (movies, browsing even coding) and all this because of linux and compatibility drivers. Tried with windows but stuff would crash (suggestions being drivers updates...suuure, IF I CAN GET SOME)."

            "body": "In a radical new approach to astrobiology, NASA JPL astrophysicist Slava Turyshev and colleagues have been honing an ingenious new mission concept that would use Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity to make detailed observations of exoearths.\n\nDrawing on Einstein\u2019s Relativity in which massive objects bend light, space and time, the mission would use the massive gravity of our own star as a solar gravitational lens (SGL) to magnify a given exoearth in optical and infrared wavelengths.\n\nThe idea potentially involves sending a flotilla of solar sail spacecraft out to some 650 AU (Earth-Sun distances) \u2014- some 16 times further than our dwarf planet Pluto \u2014- to make the observations. Once on station, after careful alignment, the spacecraft would use our own star to gravitationally lens exoearths located within 100 light years of our solar system.\n\nThe idea is that the SGL observatory would be able to characterize the planet\u2019s mass, orbit, atmosphere and surface topography at a resolution of only 15 to 25 km across. It would also offer high certainty as to whether the planet harbors life.\n\nThe final spacecraft architecture is only now being developed, but the project received two million dollars\u2019 worth of funding for preliminary studies as part of NASA\u2019s Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program. The team is now taking the project public with the June launch of the nonprofit Solar Gravitational Lens Foundation.\n\nAs for the mission itself, one of the first hurdles is simply to get there. But Turyshev says that such an observatory could launch by late next decade and by using solar sails and ion propulsion could arrive on station within 25 years.\n\nThe concept\u2019s NIAC Phase III effort was successfully completed in September 2022, says Turyshev, the new SGL Foundation\u2019s executive director, told me via email. We have shown that SGL is our only means that humanity to directly see the surface of exoplanets to confirm life, he says.\n\nA meter-class optical telescope with a modest coronagraph (an optical device that effectively simulates a solar eclipse) operating in SGL's focal region, beyond 650 AU could detect an exoplanet\u2019s signs of habitability. This would include observing seasonal changes, imaging surface topography, obtaining spectroscopy of the atmosphere and modeling the climate. Closer targets would yield higher-resolution images over shorter timeframes.\n\nBecause our own Sun wobbles a bit due to the gravitational influence of our own Jupiter and Saturn, the mission would periodically use ion thrusters to adjust to our own star\u2019s movements.\n\nLight received from the disk of an distant exoplanet using such a natural lens would appear deconstructed by the Sun\u2019s gravitational lens. Thus, the Sun\u2019s natural lens of the background star and exoplanet would create a ring of light around the Sun, known as an Einstein Ring, Turyshev says. By moving the telescope to at least 650 AU, the astronomers can be assured that the separation between our Sun\u2019s own solar disk and the Einstein Ring increases, he says.\n\nThis separation becomes large enough to make it possible to block light from our Sun using a coronagraph, says Turyshev. Given an earth-like planet 100 light years from here, the SGL projects an image that is roughly 1.3 kilometers across, he says.\n\nMoving the spacecraft within the 1.3 km image that the SGL projects and then measuring the changing brightness of the Einstein Ring amounts to \u201cscanning\u201d the image one pixel at a time, says Turyshev.\n\nFor an earth-like planet at this great distance, it is possible to scan as many as 100 x 100 pixels or more over the course of a year, he says. For a planet that is closer to Earth, at the distance of Alpha Centauri (4.3 light years) for example, even a megapixel image is possible, says Turyshev.\n\nFrom there, it\u2019s a question of image and data processing.\n\nOnce the data from most image pixels are collected, I can start processing the data to recover an unblurred image of the target, says Turyshev. Depending on the size of the planet and its distance from us, the entire process of image recovery may take anywhere from a period of a few months to a little over a year, he says.\n\nAs for how the mission would communicate with Earth?\n\nThe one-way light travel time between Earth and the spacecraft at 650 AU is 3.75 days, says Turyshev. Optical communication will make it possible to achieve data rates of megabits per second; sufficient for the mission to send back raw observational data, he says.\n\nAs for the initiative\u2019s biggest challenge?\n\nThe transition from the NASA NIAC environment into the real world, says Turyshev. We are in the process of forming an organization that will be able to implement the mission while working with NASA, government, academia, industry, and our international partners, he says.\n\nBut now fundraising is their biggest challenge. Current cost estimates for a full mission range up to some $520 million.\n\nIf the mission is successful, would the astronomers be able to say that a given exoplanet harbors life?\n\nWe will look for spectral lines that may indicate the presence of life (oxygen, nitrogen, methane, etc.) and that helps us characterize life, says Turyshev. The mission could also obtain atmospheric spectroscopy to look for weak biosignatures in the form of secondary metabolic molecules like dimethyl sulfide (an organic sulfur produced by ocean algae) and isoprene (a biogenic compound primarily emitted by vegetation), he says.\n\nCoupled with such secondary biosignatures, Turyshev says the mission would have enough data to unambiguously identify the signs of habitability.\n\nThis could be humanity\u2019s best option to truly find life on a nearby exoearth.\n\nGiven fundamental constraints in optics, using the SGL is our only way to see exoplanetary surfaces in our lifetimes, says Turyshev. In that sense, SGL is the ultimate technique; no new technologies even come close, he says."

If even there would be enough fuel to reposition for a new target.\n\nSo, my understanding is that basically each craft is sent on it's own mission, to a location out on the 650AU sphere placing it in position to image it's one and only target. Or am I missing something?"

During a Twitter Spaces event attended by Semafor, he claimed his new large language model was trained on data pulled from the web and online medical journals. The tech powering the AI is reportedly based on a modified version of OpenAI\u2019s wildly popular ChatGPT. Dozens of other companies at this point, including Snap, have already released their own subject or industry-focused AI alternatives powered by ChatGPT. As for the name \u201cDr. Gupta,\u201d that was reportedly picked because it includes the letters GPT. Yes, it\u2019s dumb, but so are most of the other names for LLMs to this point. \n>\n>...\n>\n>Since then Shkreli tried to briefly reinvent himself, like many do, as a Crypto Bro by starting Druglike, a company that claims to want to democratize the costs of drug discovery through decentralized computing. Less than a year out of jail, however, Shkreli is already back in regulators\u2019 crosshairs with the FTC recently asking a federal judge to hold the Pharma Bro in contempt of court for failing to give them the info they needed to determine if he was indeed breaking back into the medical industry. Old habits, it seems, are hard to break.\n>\n>To put it mildly, there are a lot of potential problems with the Pharma Bro\u2019s new AI adventure. For starters, its difficult to see how launching an AI tool giving medical advice and recommending certain drugs wouldn\u2019t violate Shkreli\u2019s drug industry ban. Then there\u2019s the issue of accuracy. Disclaimer or not, Dr. Gupta could quickly run into some real problems recommending its users false or harmful informaiton. Large language models, including ChatGPT, are well known to \u201challucinate\u201d or basically make up answers to questions that could have no real basis in fact. That\u2019s annoying when you ask it to create a cocktail, but its potentially life threatening if you ask it to tell you about a medical dose. Concerns over Gupta\u2019s medical accuracy didn\u2019t seem to bother Shkreli though.\n>\n>\u201cHow do you prevent a physician from doing the same?\u201d he said on Twitter.\n>\n>Then there\u2019s the issue of all that sensitive medical data Dr. Gupta is potentially gobbling up every time a user submits a query. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other regulatory protections place stricter regulations on how companies can use and share health data. Those restrictions could look like land mines Gupta will have to constantly struggle to dance around.\n\nThat question of his has got to be one that's done in bad faith. The way you prevent a physician from recommending the wrong treatments is 1) rigorous and ongoing education and training; 2) professional standards and ethics; and 3) massive legal liabilities. His LLM has none of those things."

It would be better at triage in an emergency department. Not for the obvious serious injuries but the patients that wait 5-6 hours could be seen in an order more based on medical need and not by the receptionist. Shkreli might be a shitty human being but AI could and should replace most family doctors. It would also eliminate doctor shortages and the length of time to train them.

Do you even think government, companies, orgs care that much about you unless you're rich?\n\nToo much abuse of power, fame, and wealth is undermining useful tech that actually solves many problems. Iykyk. Also, no one cares about your privacy etc, the government/corporations already spy and know all it's people. It's only an ethics and privacy nightmare for evil corrupt companies. Who's life are we really respecting? It's 2020+ the weak minded perish, we are literally in a new era, this ain't the iron or information age anymore... G12, EWF, etc would know, come on.\n\nIf you want to become biological immortal or create things, this path is what rich losers would want, sounds counterintuitive ... It's not even bad, beyond Earth is just the beginning, Earth is just the tutorial phase, imagine being hardstuck on Earth because of other dumb humans is like being stuck in bronze league 2\u00a2\n\nIt doesn't matter how rich, powerful, and famous you are. If the majority of your team sucks, you will lose. That's what life is, a team sport of collaboration to survive. \n\n\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0"

An airplane autopilot is a dumb computer, you tell it to hold an altitude and it will go up or down to hold that altitude. You tell it to stay on a line between two navigation fixes, it will turn left and right to follow that line. But it can definitely do the wrong thing, or try to kill you, or just decide a condition is too much for it and shut off. We don\u2019t trust autopilots in airplanes, they\u2019re just a tool to reduce workload but you need to manage it and watch it like a hawk. \nThis is the philosophy of Tesla autopilot, it\u2019ll stay in the lanes it\u2019s directed to, switch when necessary, and follow traffic ahead.\nTL;DR Tesla engineers named it autopilot based off how real autopilots work, the marketing department took it too far."

The unique characteristics of superconductors include zero electrical resistance, meaning zero electrical losses, and very high power density.  They also require a much smaller surface area.  As they can operate at higher currents and lower voltages, they need a lot less copper.\n\n* To meet increasing electricity demands, future transmission grids will have to reliably transfer bulk electricity over distances of hundreds of kilometres \u2013 connecting consumption hubs with areas of production, which are often located far away.\n\n* CERN\u2019s expertise in the areas of cryogenics and vacuums will be used to test and analyse sample materials and subsystems for their suitability in SuperNode\u2019s superconducting cable systems.\n\n* Physicists and engineers at CERN use the world's largest and most complex scientific instruments to probe the fundamental laws of nature.

Then Imgur comes along, simplifies and streamlines everything, almost instantly cornering the market (or at least it felt that way at the time). The difference was night and day from a user perspective because it was just so much better than the competition.\n\nThe closest thing I can think of is how Zoom just kind of showed up on most people's radars seemingly instantaneously during the pandemic even though the likes of Skype, Adobe Connect, Cisco, etc have had corporate video call services for ages. But they were just so bad when held up against the comparatively user-friendly Zoom. I don't think I know a single person IRL who knew about Zoom before COVID happened, but it just inserted itself into the common vernacular in a matter of weeks like it was always there. \n\nThat's kind of what Imgur did for image hosting (specifically on places like reddit). Then they made it into its own social media experience, and now seem to be going down the Tumblr / OnlyFans route to cling to whatever profits they're losing by having NSFW content on their servers"

Unfortunately, when I finished my post, the comment chain was buried because it followed a chain where the original reply was \"elon wins again\" and was downvoted to oblivion.\n\nSo while not EXACTLY related to Ford, it covers Tesla and EV's in general.\n\nEDIT: Added the links back in, they didn't copy and paste over.\n\nEDIT EDIT: Okay, I'm done with Reddit for tonight. Making it look pretty again is too frustrating. If you want the pretty version: [https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/12ulych/were\\_not\\_putting\\_this\\_out\\_f150\\_lightning\\_fire/jh8jn69/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/12ulych/were_not_putting_this_out_f150_lightning_fire/jh8jn69/?context=3)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay, so I was intrigued by this thought.\n\n\\[\"In 2021, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) declined to open an investigation into Tesla car battery fires, calling them \"rare events.\" ... Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously said only 0.01% of Teslas have ever caught fire. That compares with an annual rate of 0.08% for all passenger and heavy-duty vehicles in a given year, according to NHTSA and the National Fire Protection Association.\"\\]([https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/tesla-car-battery-fire-needed-6000-gallons-water-to-extinguish-rcna68153](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/tesla-car-battery-fire-needed-6000-gallons-water-to-extinguish-rcna68153))\n\n\\[Tesla-Fire shows 182 incidents involving a Tesla product, not just vehicles. Scrolling through the reports, not even all 183 fires were caused by the Tesla product but simply involved a Tesla product in a fire.\\]([https://www.tesla-fire.com](https://www.tesla-fire.com))\n\n\\[\"In the new 2021 Impact Report, Tesla revealed also the data in a different way, that from 2021 to 2021, there were approximately five Tesla vehicle fires for every billion miles traveled, while the national average for all vehicles is 53.\"\\]([https://insideevs.com/news/584722/tesla-car-fires-statistic-2021/](https://insideevs.com/news/584722/tesla-car-fires-statistic-2021/))\n\n\\[3,646,660 Teslas have been sold since 2013.\\]([https://www.investing.com/academy/statistics/tesla-facts/](https://www.investing.com/academy/statistics/tesla-facts/))\n\nSo let's do some rough math and see if Elon's claims match.\n\n182 / 3,646,660 = 0.0005018290709%\n\nEven in 2013, there were 5 fire-related incidents and only 22,442 Teslas delivered. That gives us a chance of 0.002227% which is still significantly less than the NHTSA average.\n\nI even tried to cherry-pick the numbers here. Using the year with the most fire incidents to try and get some percentage that might explain the rift between facts and reality and yet I can't make the numbers do that. Using the year with the most fire incidents, 2022 with 56 fire incidents and the year with the least amount of Teslas sold, we still come out to 0.00249% chance of catching fire. Hell, even if we compare all Tesla fire incidents to the first year Tesla vehicles were sold, we end up with 0.0081% which is the only combination that even came close to Elon's claim. Now there was an event were an unknown number of Teslas burned down due to an external fire, and another where a single Tesla resulted in more Tesla vehicles burning down. This could explain the differences in numbers, but even with that in mind, we're still not approaching ICE fire percentages.\n\nSo either I can't find reliable enough numbers for Teslas that have caught fire, or more shockingly, Elon was being quite modest in his assertation that Teslas are less likely to catch fire than ICE vehicles. However, I can see how the math Business Insider quoted was able to skew the numbers to make it seem like Teslas catch fire way more often than ICE vehicles.\n\nChris Brown disingenuously compared vehicle deaths by fire instead of vehicle fires. In these calculations, Mr. Brown neglected to mention that 365 people dying in a car fire was reported only if the cause of death was fire. Mr. Brown then proceeds to calculate Tesla's using ALL deaths where a vehicle caught fire. This is very piss poor math, and absolutely intentional to create an intelligent-sounding response without any actual basis.\n\n\\[\"According to the National Fire Protection Association, a gasoline-fueled car fire occurs every five minutes. From 2013 through 2017, there were 117,400 U.S. car fires per annum. Given the 261 million vehicles on the road at the time, the incident rate was 0.045 percent... The third-party online organization AutoInsuranceEZ recently published additional information after diving into data from the National Transportation Safety Board and government recall statistics. Hybrid vehicle fires ranked first with 3474.5 fires per 100,000 vehicle sales (16,051 fires). Next came ICE cars with 1520.9 fires per 100,000 sales (199,533 fires). BEVs were at the very bottom of this calamity heap with only 25.1 fires per 100,000 vehicle sales (52 fires).\"\\]([https://www.hagerty.com/media/opinion/ev-fires-not-coming-to-a-garage-near-you-statistically-speaking/#:\\~:text=Hybrid%20vehicle%20fires%20ranked%20first,100%2C000%20sales%20(199%2C533%20fires)](https://www.hagerty.com/media/opinion/ev-fires-not-coming-to-a-garage-near-you-statistically-speaking/#:~:text=Hybrid%20vehicle%20fires%20ranked%20first,100%2C000%20sales%20(199%2C533%20fires)))\n\n\\[In fact, 3 of every 5 vehicle fire deaths were caused by the crash or overturning of the vehicle starting a fire.\\]([https://www.nfpa.org/-/media/Files/News-and-Research/Fire-statistics-and-reports/Fact-sheets/FireLossFacts.ashx](https://www.nfpa.org/-/media/Files/News-and-Research/Fire-statistics-and-reports/Fact-sheets/FireLossFacts.ashx))\n\nThe math just doesn't support the claims that Teslas are just \"spontaneously combusting like all the time\". In fact, there are only 36 reported Tesla vehicles that burned due to spontaneous combustion since Teslas inception.\n\nBut can an ICE car spontaneously combust? It turns out, yes they can. Electrical shorts can indeed cause spontaneous combustion. \\[Hyundai had to recall a ton of vehicles and replace the ABS module because it was short-circuiting and setting the car on fire even if the car wasn't turned on.\\]([https://autoservice.hyundaiusa.com/Campaign188/MicroSiteTemplate/MicroSiteTemplateVINValidate/3718](https://autoservice.hyundaiusa.com/Campaign188/MicroSiteTemplate/MicroSiteTemplateVINValidate/3718)) This is because the ABS module stayed energized even when the car was off, and moisture was able to enter some of these modules.\n\nSo this isn't even unique to EV's, hell Hybrids have been bursting into flames way more often than ICE or EV's and no one is screaming about the sky falling with Hybrids.\n\nHowever, I'm just some rando on the internet, right? Let's look at Britain's not-for-profit insurer research company, Thatcham Research, for some outside opinion. So what does the CTO of Thatcham Research think?\n\n\\[\"Richard Billyeald, chief technical officer at Britain\u2019s Thatcham Research, said EVs generally appear less likely fire risks, but the data is limited. \u201cOur latest research indicates that the risk of a fire for all types of EV remains less likely than for ICE vehicles. It should be noted that the usable data only goes back five years and even now the number of EVs on the roads still represents a very small sample size. This is also reflected in the safety testing we conduct in the U.K. on behalf of Euro NCAP (European auto safety), where despite the robust impacts to the front and particularly the sides of the vehicle where the battery is most vulnerable, there have been no resultant thermal events,\u201d Billyeald said.\"\\]([https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2022/03/02/electric-car-fire-risks-look-exaggerated-but-more-data-required-for-definitive-verdict/?sh=25d43f582327](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2022/03/02/electric-car-fire-risks-look-exaggerated-but-more-data-required-for-definitive-verdict/?sh=25d43f582327))\n\nSo it appears that not only are we unable to make an honest comparison between the different vehicle types and fire-death-related crashes, but the preliminary numbers show EV vehicles are still less likely to catch fire than any of their brethren with what information is currently available. It may take years or decades to compile enough information to accurately gauge the risk of vehicle fire due to crash based on vehicle type.\n\n\\&#x200B;\n\nWhat a wild ride collecting all that information was. There are so many hit pieces and fanboy nonsense articles floating around it's difficult to find good resources."

Its not, he can ban anyone he likes, including entire nations, for any reason he likes, and also promote lies, conspiracy theories and signal boost his own weird tweets. Which is fine, because its a dumb social media service that is not important. Its probably never going to get better either because its the worlds greatest tool for a narcissist. A world sized platform that he controls.

            "body": "From the article: Gary Bowser, the hacking group member who was convicted for creating and selling circumvention devices enabling users to play illegal backups on Switch and 3DS, has been released from prison early.\n\nBowser was sentenced in February 2022 to 40 months in prison for his part as a member of a hacking group called Team-Xecuter, which in 2013 began creating and selling circumvention devices enabling users to play illegal ROMs on consoles, including Switch and 3DS.\n\nIn an interview with Nick Moses (as reported by TorrentFreak), Bowser said he was released from federal prison in late March, and is now at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington, where he\u2019s undergoing processing before returning to Canada.\n\nHowever, Bowser now has to fulfil the other part of his sentence, in which he has been ordered to pay $14.5 million in damages, of which a $10 million payment to Nintendo is considered the priority.\n\nIn the interview, Bowser claimed he has paid $175 of this to date, which came from the job he was doing in prison, but says that upon his release he will have to start paying a percentage of his gross monthly income to Nintendo.\n\n\u201cWith the agreement with [Nintendo], the maximum they can take is between 25% and 30% of your monthly gross income,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cAnd I have up until, like, six months before I have to start making payments.\u201d\n\nIn order to pay off Nintendo fully under this agreement, Bowser would have to earn at least $40 million before taxes. Given that Bowser is 53 years old, TorrentFreak suggests this will mean Bowser is unlikely to ever fully clear his debt and will likely be paying Nintendo for the rest of his life.\n\nIn June 2022 a transcript of Bowser\u2019s sentencing was received by Axios, in which Nintendo lawyer Ajay Singh reportedly said the sentencing was a \u201cunique opportunity\u201d to send a message about piracy."

How does that affect the judgement?\n\nA: Not much.\n\nAll Nintendo has to do is register the judgement in the Canadian courts of the province where Bowser resides and file for enforcement of the judgement, and Canada, as America's bitch, will enforce it.\n\nThe exception is the $4.5M fine. Canada doesn't allow punitive damages, and won't enforce punitive damage judgements. The other $10M in civil damages, however, are a different story. Unless he could prove that the court was corrupt or didn't have jurisdiction -- and that was already tried during the extradition hearing and Canada at that time determined the court was not corrupt and did have jurisdiction -- that judgement is fully enforcable in Canada.\n\nOf course, Bowser could render himself judgement-proof by living asset and income-free as a homeless person on the streets of Vancouver, getting his food from soup kitchens and food pantries and his clothes from homeless outreach charities. But then Nintendo could claim he was deliberately avoiding paying his judgement and request that a court find him in contempt and punish him until he agrees to get a job. How far Nintendo is willing to take this is hard to tell, but given their track record thus far, their pettiness cannot be underestimated."

Their computer simulations are vastly superior to those of the past, and experiments like DAHRT\u2019s are more powerful.\n\n>Simulation can\u2019t be the only tool used to understand the bombs, however. All humans, even weapons physicists, are storytellers, [Los Alamos\u2019s head of weapons physics] Nakhleh says, and the simulations help them create confident narratives. But that can only go so far. \n\n>\u201cAt some point,\u201d Nakhleh says, \u201cyou have to step into the unknown\u2014walk into the dark room, and see, \u2018What did the experiment have to say?\u2019\u201d\n\n>&nbsp;\n\n>In a real weapon, conventional explosives ringing an actual pit would implode the plutonium to a critical density, triggering an explosive fissile chain reaction. Its energy would drive the fusion of hydrogen isotopes in the weapon\u2019s second stage, generating yet more neutrons that would split additional fission fuel.\n\n>This fission-fusion-fission process eats up some of the atoms\u2019 mass and, according to E=mc2, Albert Einstein\u2019s famous equation, releases ferocious amounts of energy. That\u2019s why a warhead about 1 meter long can explode with the force of a megaton of TNT. \n\n>If dropped on a city like Washington, D.C., it would instantly vaporize an area more than 2.5 kilometers across while crumpling buildings much farther out with its radioactive blast. It would kill nearly half a million people and injure or sicken almost as many.\n\n^1 Sarah Scoles (20 Apr. 2023), \u201cTrust but verify \u2014 U.S. labs are overhauling the nuclear stockpile.

They\u2019re extremely brittle, and the lcd pops off the lids due to again, poor plastics in the lid making the screw posts snap, dropping the screws. This is mostly caused from just opening & closing the lid in normal use. Acers are the the absolute worst chrome book you could get, most notably the R721T\u2019s. You could almost crumble the plastics in your hand it\u2019s so brittle. The cases completely flex with the smallest bit of pressure. HP\u2019s are slightly, very very very slightly better than acer.

Cases on 90% of the ones I serviced had shitty plastic bodies that used friction screws to mount the hinges. I would be surprised if those lasted more than 500 opens. Another common one was power buttons breaking off the motherboard from general use. My favorite was when I would put a brand new motherboard in, turn it on to do the setup and immediately have the power button break off. We couldn't pull our contract on those either whatever school had bought them had a long service contract on some 3 thousand units we sold them. Another favorite in the shop was motherboard screws untightening *even with loctite* jiggling around the case and shorting the board.\n\nIdk why people would ever buy these. And the excuse of \"oh they're for 3rd through 9th graders\" Is total bullshit. There are other laptops for that price point or cheaper that dont have those design flaws.

Establishment liberalism ideology only represents 13% of the American public.\n\nThe most likely explanation for these results is that ChatGPT has been trained on a large corpus of textual data gathered from the Internet with an expected overrepresentation of establishment sources of information: news media, academic literature, etc. It has been well documented that the majority of professionals working in these institutions are politically left-leaning. It is conceivable that the political orientation of such professionals influences the textual content that they create through their work. Hence, the political tilt displayed by a model trained on such content.\n\nAnother possibility suggested to me by AI researcher \u00c1lvaro Barbero Jim\u00e9nez is that if a team of human labelers were hired to rank the quality of the model outputs in conversations, and the model was fine-tuned to improve that metric of quality and that set of humans in the loop displayed biases when judging the biases of the model, those raters\u2019 biases might have percolated into the model parameters."

They do not understand or care about context.  They will give you the *exact* information you tell it to give you, even if it's not the answer you want, accept, or even believed you would get.   \n\nThis is no different.  If X number of teenagers look up videos on suicide, the algorithm is going to push suicide videos to teenagers, because as far as the algorithm is concerned, \"teenagers like suicide videos\".  That's all it cares about.  \"Here's a teenager.  56% (percentage made up) of teenagers watch suicide videos.  Therefore, the subject of suicide is popular among teenagers.  Therefore, here's all the suicide videos I can vomit up.\"\n\nIt doesn't understand that a suicide prevention video and a video of one teenager talking about how he's going to off himself are completely different subjects.  It doesn't understand why the suicide prevention video is useful and the teenager advocating suicide is harmful.   If somehow both videos are labelled in the \"suicide\" category or something, it's going to treat them equally and push them equally unless specifically told not to.  \n\nThe same goes for any algorithm.  If you say \"If X, then Y\", it will spit out Y every time you input X, whether you actually want Y or not.  It has no knowledge of or concern for context.  It can't figure out why Y is a valid answer in most cases, but should be excluded in others.  It can't make on-the-fly judgements the way a human can, knowing when to exclude certain results even when they would be technically correct answers, or add results that would normally be excluded because of slightly different context.  \n\nDon't get me wrong.  There are a *lot* of things wrong with Tik Tok.  I'm not trying to excuse them in any way.  But this would be an issue regardless of the platform.   The fact that teenagers see more suicide videos isn't so much an issue with Tik Tok itself, it's an issue (a) with algorithms in general, and (b) the logical result of the mental health, identity, and suicide rates of teenagers in our society today.   The answer to the problem isn't something Tik Tok is responsible for.   So long as suicide is such a widely viewed topic among teenagers, algorithms will continue to push suicide videos to teenagers because that's what it's told to do.  The context of the videos and the fact that this just makes the teen suicide problems worse is not a concern of the algorithm, and the problem will continue as long as we continue marginalizing mental health issues in this country and aggressively pushing agendas that don't so much as allow teenagers to find and express their identity, let alone seek help from professionals.  \n\nTik Tok pushing these videos is a *result* of the problem, not the problem itself."

It\u2019s going to start showing more posts from that subreddit and recommending subreddits similar in concept to the ones you interact with. It will also take into account with subreddits you DO subscribe to, and start using those to suggest other, similar communities. TikTok is not some outlier here.

If you follow a certain TikTok creator, it\u2019s going to assume you want to see content by similar creators.

Should we consider that the supply of these topics may be increasing, which is necessarily biasing the consumption towards these topics?\n\nA comment above said something about unsubbing from content, then having that same content pushed to them. The answer is staring you in the face: tiktok is just pushing what people are talking about and what is being created directly to you, whether you want to see it or not. It's not reddit, you aren't subscribed to a community that filters your intake up front. People post things, they get views, they get pushed to more people. Suicide is obviously trending, seeing as how its occurrence is on the rise and our language has been normalizing and humorizing it for a while. \n\nI see the content created on tiktok and the generational mindset as more of a rather hopeless last cry for help to stop that societal trend, rather than a social media platform biasing towards pushing negative content. \n\nSuicide is only one example. We've recently had a trend of normalizing it with dark humor, making it an easy topic to talk about. It's becoming a more mainstream thing, and it also is *increasing* in occurrence in the population. OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IT MORE, IT'S HAPPENING MORE AND IS BEING NORMALIZED. Gen z has been non chalant discussing it and joking about it for *years*. Other topics like police brutality, school shootings, other taboo content that you're consuming more and more daily are not being *caused* by the social media platform. They are *actually happening more frequently*. \n\nCould it not be that gen z is just actually more jaded to these topics and more likely to explore them due to their generational mindset of societal hopelessness and their longer exposure to this negative trend? Are we sure we are trying to ban a platform for pushing content and pointing blame at that platform instead of addressing the issues that inspire people to generate the content in the first place? \n\nThink critically for 3 seconds here. Is this really a conspiracy for the Chinese gov to inject a hate cycle into the US? Is our content being targeted toward detrimental societal values with malintent? Or are we just *actually* self imploding and social media is reflecting/reinforcing that? They wouldn't be able to intentionally push the content if we didn't create it in the first place. I can definitely see tiktok as a catalyst for speeding up our vicious cycle, but we aren't going to break the cycle by addressing the symptoms and ignoring root causes. \n\nTldr: I totally agree that this is an issue as social media is just reinforcing the cultural sentiment around the topic, and generally think tiktok is a net negative for us, but banning it and stopping discussion over it is the opposite of fixing the underlying issues it is bringing into the discussion. Social media is just a catalyst, the root cause is a  structural and entrenched systemic societal failure that will play out independently whether we have social media or not."

Developed for the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), the Terranaut aims to operate autonomously in beach and surf zones, the areas where Marines often train and fight.\n\nThe Terranaut is based on Nauticus' previous work with aquatic uncrewed vehicles, particularly the Aquanaut, which is a submersible robot capable of operating at depths of up to 10,000 feet and distances of up to 75 miles. The Aquanaut's features, such as retractable manipulator arms and the ability to operate without direct communication through an umbilical wire, have informed the Terranaut's design.\n\nThe Terranaut can navigate on treads and with powerful thrusters, and it has plans for manipulator arms that can emerge from its body to perform tasks like disassembling underwater mines. Its autonomous control system can receive human direction through acoustic communication, allowing it to swim and crawl without an umbilical connection to a boat.\n\nThis innovation aims to create a new class of subsea machines that can manipulate objects underwater without the need for an umbilical. The Terranaut's design will allow it to navigate its environment and perform tasks using adaptive autonomy and remote human guidance, providing a new tool for mine countermeasures in beach and surf zones."

Oral exams and hand-written papers take more time to grade than a scantron sheet. \n\nIn a place like the US, the number of teachers per university would have to increase to make this possible, I would think. This is because they could not rely on an army of grad students to grade something like oral exams. \n\nAnd for lower school levels like high school its even clearer that staffing levels would need to go up. Though perhaps I'm not thinking about this the right way and maybe with less testing in total staff levels wouldn't have to up so much, I'm not sure.\n\nRegardless its teaching to the test that we need to get away from. To paraphrase Gore Vidal - \"You check a box? Thats no way to learn anything... I tell teachers I've never met an uninteresting 6 year old, and I've never met an interesting 16 year old - what have you done?\". He's being snarky here of course but the point is we need to get away from this scantron, check a box style of teaching. Its suitable for certain subjects and questions sure but we've gone too far. Get back to human rather than machine/process focused teaching and the problem of chatgpt diminishes significantly."

You have to give students the tools/technology to actually write the essay, a way to collect the comparatively complex response data, and hire huge teams of graders who can navigate the minutiae of difference between a 5/10 essay and a 6/10. Much cheaper to evaluate simple bits of data, correct multiple-choice or incorrect.\n\nI foresee AI cheating causing schools to eliminate writing more and more and replacing them with simpler right/wrong assessments, rather than invest in networks of educators who can devote even 10 minutes of their bloated, overworked schedules to attend an oral exam appointment."
